# Hilbert polynomials

In this file, we formalise the following statement: if `F` is a field with characteristic `0`, then
given any `p : F[X]` and `d : ℕ`, there exists some `h : F[X]` such that for any large enough
`n : ℕ`, `h(n)` is equal to the coefficient of `Xⁿ` in the power series expansion of `p/(1 - X)ᵈ`.
This `h` is unique and is denoted as `Polynomial.hilbertPoly p d`.

For example, given `d : ℕ`, the power series expansion of `1/(1 - X)ᵈ⁺¹` in `F[X]`
is `Σₙ ((d + n).choose d)Xⁿ`, which equals `Σₙ ((n + 1)···(n + d)/d!)Xⁿ` and hence
`Polynomial.hilbertPoly (1 : F[X]) (d + 1)` is the polynomial `(X + 1)···(X + d)/d!`. Note that
if `d! = 0` in `F`, then the polynomial `(X + 1)···(X + d)/d!` no longer works, so we do not want
the characteristic of `F` to be divisible by `d!`. As `Polynomial.hilbertPoly` may take any
`p : F[X]` and `d : ℕ` as its inputs, it is necessary for us to assume that `CharZero F`.

## Main definitions

* `Polynomial.hilbertPoly p d`. Given a field `F`, a polynomial `p : F[X]` and a natural number `d`,
  if `F` is of characteristic `0`, then `Polynomial.hilbertPoly p d : F[X]` is the polynomial whose
  value at `n` equals the coefficient of `Xⁿ` in the power series expansion of `p/(1 - X)ᵈ`.

## TODO

* Hilbert polynomials of finitely generated graded modules over Noetherian rings.

For any field `F` and natural numbers `d` and `k`, `Polynomial.preHilbertPoly F d k`
is defined as `(d.factorial : F)⁻¹ • ((ascPochhammer F d).comp (X - (C (k : F)) + 1))`.
This is the most basic form of Hilbert polynomials. `Polynomial.preHilbertPoly ℚ d 0`
is exactly the Hilbert polynomial of the polynomial ring `ℚ[X_0,...,X_d]` viewed as
a graded module over itself. In fact, `Polynomial.preHilbertPoly F d k` is the
same as `Polynomial.hilbertPoly ((X : F[X]) ^ k) (d + 1)` for any field `F` and
`d k : ℕ` (see the lemma `Polynomial.hilbertPoly_X_pow_succ`). See also the lemma
`Polynomial.preHilbertPoly_eq_choose_sub_add`, which states that if `CharZero F`,
then for any `d k n : ℕ` with `k ≤ n`, `(Polynomial.preHilbertPoly F d k).eval (n : F)`
equals `(n - k + d).choose d`.

`Polynomial.hilbertPoly p 0 = 0`; for any `d : ℕ`, `Polynomial.hilbertPoly p (d + 1)`
is defined as `∑ i ∈ p.support, (p.coeff i) • Polynomial.preHilbertPoly F d i`. If
`M` is a graded module whose Poincaré series can be written as `p(X)/(1 - X)ᵈ` for some
`p : ℚ[X]` with integer coefficients, then `Polynomial.hilbertPoly p d` is the Hilbert
polynomial of `M`. See also `Polynomial.coeff_mul_invOneSubPow_eq_hilbertPoly_eval`,
which says that `PowerSeries.coeff F n (p * PowerSeries.invOneSubPow F d)` equals
`(Polynomial.hilbertPoly p d).eval (n : F)` for any large enough `n : ℕ`.
