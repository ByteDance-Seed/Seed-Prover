  (f : ℝ → ℝ)
  (h₀ : ∀ x, x ≠ -2 -> f x = 1 / (x + 2)) :
  f (f 1) = 3/7 := by 
  -- The goal is to evaluate f(f 1). We will do this in two steps:
  -- 1. Evaluate f 1.
  -- 2. Evaluate f of the result from step 1.

  -- Step 1: Evaluate f 1.
  -- We can use the hypothesis h₀ if 1 ≠ -2.
  have h₁ : (1 : ℝ) ≠ -2 := by
    -- This inequality is numerically true.
    norm_num

  -- Now we can apply h₀ with x = 1, using the proof h₁.
  -- This rewrites f 1 in the goal.
  -- The hypothesis h₀ is of the form `∀ x, P x -> Q x`. To use it, we first apply it to the specific value `x` (here 1), which gives `P 1 -> Q 1`. Then we apply this resulting implication to the proof of `P 1` (here h₁).
  rw [(h₀ 1) h₁]

  -- The goal is now f (1 / (1 + 2)) = 3/7. Let's simplify the argument of f.
  have h₂ : (1 : ℝ) / (1 + 2) = (1 : ℝ) / 3 := by
    -- Perform the numerical calculation 1 + 2 = 3 and 1 / 3 = 1/3.
    norm_num

  -- Rewrite the argument of f in the goal using the simplified value.
  rw [h₂]

  -- Step 2: Evaluate f (1/3).
  -- The goal is now f (1/3) = 3/7. We use h₀ again, this time with x = 1/3.
  -- We can use the hypothesis h₀ if 1/3 ≠ -2.
  have h₃ : (1 : ℝ) / 3 ≠ -2 := by
    -- This inequality is numerically true.
    norm_num

  -- Now we can apply h₀ with x = 1/3, using the proof h₃.
  -- This rewrites f (1/3) in the goal.
  -- Similar to the previous application of h₀, we first apply h₀ to the value (1 : ℝ) / 3, then apply the result to the proof h₃.
  rw [(h₀ ((1 : ℝ) / 3)) h₃]

  -- The goal is now 1 / (1/3 + 2) = 3/7. We need to simplify the left-hand side.
  -- We can use field_simp, which is useful for simplifying fractional expressions.
  field_simp

  -- The goal is now a numerical equality, which can be proven by norm_num.
