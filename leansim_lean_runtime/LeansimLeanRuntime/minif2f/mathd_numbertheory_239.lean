  -- The goal is to prove that the sum of integers from 1 to 12 modulo 4 is 2.
  -- The sum is sum_{k=1}^{12} k.
  -- We will evaluate the sum directly using the formula for the sum of the first n integers.
  -- We know that ∑_{k=1}^{n} k = n * (n + 1) / 2.
  -- For n=12, the sum is 12 * (12 + 1) / 2 = 12 * 13 / 2 = 6 * 13 = 78.

  -- Relate the sum over Icc to a sum over range.
  -- The previous attempt to derive the equality using set equalities `Icc_eq_Ico_succ` and `sum_Ico_eq_sum_range` resulted in an "unknown constant" error.
  -- We can use the theorem `Finset.sum_Ico_eq_sum_range` to relate `Ico` to `range`.
  -- We know that `Icc 1 12 = Ico 1 13`.
  -- The theorem `Finset.sum_Ico_eq_sum_range` states `∑ k in Ico m n, f k = ∑ k in range (n - m), f (m + k)`.

  -- This simplifies to `∑ k in Icc 1 12, k = ∑ i in range 12, (1 + i)`, which is exactly the goal.
  -- We use `exact` to prove the `have` statement by directly providing the required equality proof term.
  -- -- The previous line `exact Finset.sum_Icc_eq_sum_range (m := 1) (n := 12) (f := id)` produced an "unknown constant" error.
