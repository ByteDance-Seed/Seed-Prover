theorem mathd_numbertheory_345 :
  (2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006) % 7 = 0 := by 
  -- The goal is to prove that the sum of seven consecutive integers starting from 2000
  -- is divisible by 7.
  -- The sum is 2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006.
  -- We can evaluate this sum and the modulo operation using the `norm_num` tactic.
