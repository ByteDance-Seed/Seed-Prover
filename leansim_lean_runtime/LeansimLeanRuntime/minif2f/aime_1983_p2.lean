  -- The problem asks to prove 15 ≤ f x where f x is a sum of three absolute values.
  -- We are given that 0 < p < 15 and p ≤ x ≤ 15.
  -- We will simplify the absolute values based on the range of x and p.
  -- abs(x - p): Since p ≤ x (h₁), x - p ≥ 0. abs(x - p) = x - p.
  -- abs(x - 15): Since x ≤ 15 (h₁), x - 15 ≤ 0. abs(x - 15) = -(x - 15) = 15 - x.
  -- abs(x - p - 15): Since x ≤ 15 and 0 < p, we have x < p + 15, so x - p - 15 < 0. abs(x - p - 15) = -(x - p - 15) = -x + p + 15.
  -- Substituting these gives f x = (x - p) + (15 - x) + (-x + p + 15).
  -- This simplifies to f x = 30 - x.
  -- The goal 15 ≤ f x becomes 15 ≤ 30 - x, which is equivalent to x ≤ 15, a fact given by h₁.

  -- Expand f x using its definition.

  -- Deconstruct the hypothesis h₁ about the range of x.
  rcases h₁ with ⟨h_px, h_x15⟩

  -- Prove the inequality needed for the third absolute value.
  -- We need x - p - 15 < 0, which is equivalent to x < p + 15.
  -- From h₀, 0 < p, so adding 15 to both sides gives 15 < p + 15.
  have h_p_pos : 0 < p := h₀.left
  have h_15_lt_p_add_15 : 15 < p + 15 := by linarith [h_p_pos]

  -- Since x ≤ 15 (h_x15) and 15 < p + 15 (h_15_lt_p_add_15), by transitivity we get x < p + 15.
  have h_x_lt_p_add_15 : x < p + 15 := lt_of_le_of_lt h_x15 h_15_lt_p_add_15

  -- This inequality x < p + 15 is equivalent to x - (p + 15) < 0, which is x - p - 15 < 0.
  have h_x_p_15_neg : x - p - 15 < 0 := by linarith [h_x_lt_p_add_15]

  -- Simplify the absolute values using the proven inequalities.
  -- The hypotheses h_px (p ≤ x => x - p ≥ 0), h_x15 (x ≤ 15 => x - 15 ≤ 0), and h_x_p_15_neg (x - p - 15 < 0) are in context.
  -- simp [*] was attempted here but failed to produce the expected simplified form.
  -- We will explicitly rewrite the absolute values using `abs_of_nonneg`, `abs_of_nonpos`, `abs_of_neg`.

  -- abs(x - p): since p ≤ x, x - p ≥ 0.
  rw [abs_of_nonneg (sub_nonneg_of_le h_px)]

  rw [abs_of_nonpos (sub_nonpos_of_le h_x15)]
  -- abs(x - p - 15): since x - p - 15 < 0.
  -- -- We can use abs_of_neg (requires < 0) or abs_of_nonpos (requires <= 0).
  -- -- abs_of_neg seems more direct given h_x_p_15_neg.
  rw [abs_of_neg h_x_p_15_neg]

  -- The goal is now 15 ≤ (x - p) + (-(x - 15)) + (-(x - p - 15)).
  -- Use ring to simplify the expression on the right side.
  ring

  -- The goal is now 15 ≤ 30 - x.
  -- This is equivalent to x ≤ 30 - 15, which is x ≤ 15.
  -- We have this inequality directly as h_x15.
  -- Use linarith to prove the final inequality.
