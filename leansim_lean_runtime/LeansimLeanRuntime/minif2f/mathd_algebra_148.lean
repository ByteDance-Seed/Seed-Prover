  -- The hypothesis h₁ is now: c * 2^3 - 9 * 2 + 3 = 9.
  -- Simplify the numerical part of the equation.
  -- 2^3 = 8
  -- 9 * 2 = 18
  -- The equation becomes: c * 8 - 18 + 3 = 9, which simplifies to c * 8 - 15 = 9.
  -- simp at h₁ -- This step failed because `simp` does not automatically evaluate numerical expressions within an equation involving a variable.
  -- We replace it by proving the numerical simplification of the left-hand side explicitly using `ring` and then rewriting the hypothesis `h₁`.

    -- The numbers 2, 9, 3 are automatically coerced to ℝ in this context.

  -- The hypothesis h₁ is now: c * 8 - 15 = 9.
  -- This is a linear equation in c. We want to prove c = 3.
  -- Rearranging the equation c * 8 - 15 = 9 gives c * 8 = 9 + 15, which is c * 8 = 24.
  -- Dividing by 8 gives c = 3.
  -- The linarith tactic can solve linear equations like this.
