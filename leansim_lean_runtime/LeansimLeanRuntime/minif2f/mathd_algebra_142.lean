  -- Subtract h₁ from h₀ to eliminate b and solve for m.

    -- The previous attempt used `rw [← mul_assoc, inv_mul_cancel_left h8_nonzero]`
    -- The first rewrite `rw [← mul_assoc]` transformed the LHS from `(8 : ℝ)⁻¹ * (8 * m)` to `((8 : ℝ)⁻¹ * 8) * m`.
    -- The second rewrite `inv_mul_cancel_left` expects the form `a⁻¹ * (a * b)`, not `(a⁻¹ * a) * b`.
    -- We need to prove `(8 : ℝ)⁻¹ * (8 * m) = m`.
    -- This is of the form a⁻¹ * (a * b) = b, which is true in a field (like ℝ) when a ≠ 0.
