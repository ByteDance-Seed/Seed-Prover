  -- The original code had an error using an undefined variable 'h_mul'.
  -- This section needs to establish the relationship between m, n, their gcd, and their lcm.

  -- We use the theorem `Nat.gcd_mul_lcm m n` to introduce this equality.
  -- The theorem `Nat.gcd_mul_lcm m n` proves `Nat.gcd m n * Nat.lcm m n = m * n`.
