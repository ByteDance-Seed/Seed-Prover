  -- The hypothesis h₂ is an equation involving integers (due to casting and integer literal 3).
  -- We are given y = 5 * x by h₁. We can substitute y in h₂.
  -- The direct rewrite `rw [h₁] at h₂` fails because h₁ is an equality in ℕ (5 * x = y),
  -- but the occurrence of y in h₂ is cast to ℤ (↑y).
  -- We first need to show that casting h₁ to ℤ preserves the equality.
  -- The previous attempt `rw [h₁] at h₂` failed because the pattern `y` from `h₁` was not directly found in `h₂`, where it appears as `↑y`.
  -- We need to first prove that `↑y = ↑(5 * x)` as integers, and then rewrite using this new equality.
  have h_cast_eq : (↑y : ℤ) = (↑(5 * x) : ℤ) := by
    -- Since y = 5 * x (h₁), applying the cast function `(↑· : ℤ)` to both sides preserves the equality.
    -- We can rewrite `h₁` directly in this goal `(↑y : ℤ) = (↑(5 * x) : ℤ)`.
    rw [h₁]
    -- The goal is now `(↑(5 * x) : ℤ) = (↑(5 * x) : ℤ)`, which is definitionally true.
    -- This line was redundant as the goal was already definitionally equal after `rw [h₁]`.
    -- rfl
  -- Now we can use this casted equality `h_cast_eq` to rewrite `(↑y : ℤ)` in `h₂`.
  rw [h_cast_eq] at h₂
  -- h₂ is now: (↑x - (3:ℤ)) + (↑(5 * x) - (3:ℤ)) = 30
  -- The term ↑(5 * x) can be simplified using Nat.cast_mul, which states ↑(a*b) = ↑a * ↑b for appropriate types.
  rw [Nat.cast_mul] at h₂
  -- h₂ is now: (↑x - (3:ℤ)) + ((↑(5 : ℕ)) * ↑x - (3:ℤ)) = 30 -- The type annotation on 5 is important
  -- Let's simplify the left side of this integer equation using algebraic properties.
  -- The expression (↑x - 3) + ((↑(5 : ℕ) : ℤ) * ↑x - 3) simplifies to (↑x + (↑(5 : ℕ) : ℤ) * ↑x) - (3 + 3) = (1 + (↑(5 : ℕ) : ℤ)) * ↑x - 6.
  -- Since (↑(5 : ℕ) : ℤ) is definitionally equal to (5 : ℤ), this simplifies to (1 + 5) * ↑x - 6 = 6 * ↑x - 6.
  -- We need to derive the equality (↑x - 3) + ((↑(5 : ℕ) : ℤ) * ↑x - 3) = 6 * ↑x - 6.
  -- The previous definition of `h_simplified_lhs` used `(5 : ℤ)` instead of `(↑(5 : ℕ) : ℤ)` which appeared after `rw [Nat.cast_mul]`.
  -- We redefine `h_simplified_lhs` to use `(↑(5 : ℕ) : ℤ)` to exactly match the expression in `h₂` before simplification.
  have h_simplified_lhs : (↑x - 3) + ((↑(5 : ℕ) : ℤ) * ↑x - 3) = 6 * ↑x - 6 := by ring
  -- Now we can rewrite `h₂` using the simplified left-hand side.
  rw [h_simplified_lhs] at h₂
  -- h₂ is now: 6 * ↑x - 6 = 30 (in ℤ)
  -- This is a linear equation in the integer ↑x. We can solve it for ↑x using linarith.
  -- From 6 * ↑x - 6 = 30, linarith derives 6 * ↑x = 36.
  -- Although h₂ is in ℤ, linarith seems to infer the result type based on the goal,
  -- which is x = 6 (in ℕ). The resulting hypothesis `h_int_eq` is thus in ℕ: (6 : ℕ) * x = (36 : ℕ).
  have h_int_eq : 6 * ↑x = 36 := by linarith [h₂]

  -- We have the equation (6 : ℕ) * x = (36 : ℕ) from h_int_eq.
  -- We need to show 36 = 6 * 6 as natural numbers to use cancellation.
  have h_thirty_six_nat_eq : (36 : ℕ) = (6 : ℕ) * (6 : ℕ) := by norm_num
  -- Substitute this natural number equality into h_int_eq.
  rw [h_thirty_six_nat_eq] at h_int_eq
  -- h_int_eq is now (6 : ℕ) * x = (6 : ℕ) * (6 : ℕ).
  -- We can use the property that in natural numbers, if k * m = k * n and k ≠ 0, then m = n.
  -- This property is Nat.mul_left_cancel. We need to show that 6 is not zero as a natural number.
  -- The theorem `Nat.mul_left_cancel` requires a proof that the left multiplier is positive (`0 < a`).
  -- We provide a proof that `0 < (6 : ℕ)`.
  have h_six_positive : 0 < (6 : ℕ) := by norm_num
  -- Apply Nat.mul_left_cancel with k = 6, m = x, n = 6 to conclude x = 6.
