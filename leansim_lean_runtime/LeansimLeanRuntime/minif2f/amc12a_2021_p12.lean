    -- The goal is to show that for any complex number z, evaluating the polynomial P at z
    -- gives the same result as applying the function f to z.
    -- This is a proof by definition unfolding and simplification.

    -- Let z be an arbitrary complex number.
    intro z

    -- First, we use the definition of P given by P_def.
    -- This substitutes the explicit form of the polynomial P into the left-hand side (LHS) of the goal.
    rw [P_def]
    -- The goal is now:
    -- Polynomial.eval z (X ^ 6 - C (10 : ℂ) * X ^ 5 + C (ofReal' a) * X ^ 4 + ... + C (16 : ℂ)) = f z

    -- Next, we use the definition of f z given by h₀.
    -- This substitutes the explicit form of f z into the right-hand side (RHS) of the goal.
    rw [h₀ z]
    -- The goal is now:
    -- Polynomial.eval z (X ^ 6 - C (10 : ℂ) * X ^ 5 + C (ofReal' a) * X ^ 4 + C (ofReal' b) * X ^ 3 + C (ofReal' c) * X ^ 2 + C (ofReal' d) * X + C (16 : ℂ))

    -- The `simp` tactic is used to simplify the LHS.
    -- `Polynomial.eval` has several simplification lemmas associated with it, which `simp` will use.
    -- These lemmas describe how `Polynomial.eval` interacts with polynomial constructors and operations.
    -- Key lemmas include:
    -- - `Polynomial.eval_add`: states `eval z (Q + R) = eval z Q + eval z R`
    -- - `Polynomial.eval_sub`: states `eval z (Q - R) = eval z Q - eval z R`
    -- - `Polynomial.eval_C`: states `eval z (C c) = c` (evaluating a constant polynomial yields the constant)
    -- - `Polynomial.eval_X`: states `eval z X = z` (evaluating the indeterminate X yields z)
    -- - `Polynomial.eval_pow`: states `eval z (Q ^ n) = (eval z Q) ^ n`
    -- - `Polynomial.eval_mul`: states `eval z (Q * R) = eval z Q * eval z R`
    -- More specific lemmas that `simp` will likely use, derived from the above or as standalone simp lemmas:
    -- - `Polynomial.eval_X_pow`: states `eval z (X ^ n) = z ^ n`
    -- - `Polynomial.eval_C_mul`: states `eval z (C c * Q) = c * eval z Q`

    -- Applying these lemmas, `simp` will transform the LHS term by term:
    -- For example, `Polynomial.eval z (X ^ 6)` simplifies to `z ^ 6`.
    -- `Polynomial.eval z (C (10 : ℂ) * X ^ 5)` simplifies to `(10 : ℂ) * (Polynomial.eval z (X ^ 5))`, which further simplifies to `(10 : ℂ) * z ^ 5`.
    -- `Polynomial.eval z (C (ofReal' a) * X ^ 4)` simplifies to `ofReal' a * (Polynomial.eval z (X ^ 4))`, which becomes `ofReal' a * z ^ 4`.
    -- This process applies to all terms in the polynomial.
    -- The constant term `Polynomial.eval z (C (16 : ℂ))` simplifies to `(16 : ℂ)`.
    -- The `simp` tactic will then combine these simplified terms using the rules for `Polynomial.eval_add` and `Polynomial.eval_sub`.
    -- The resulting expression for the LHS will be identical to the RHS.
    simp
    -- After `simp` successfully applies these transformations, the goal becomes an identity
    -- (e.g., `expression = expression`), which is true by reflexivity (`rfl`).
    -- The hypothesis `h₁` is not needed for this proof, as it describes properties of the roots of `f`
    -- (i.e., values of `z` for which `f z = 0`), rather than the definition of `f z` itself.
