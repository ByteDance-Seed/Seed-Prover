  -- The goal is (Complex.I / 2)^2 = -(1 / 4).
  -- The number 2 is a natural number, which is automatically coerced to a complex number.
  -- The number 1/4 is a rational number, which is automatically coerced to a complex number.

  -- Current goal: (Complex.I * (2 : ℂ)⁻¹) * (Complex.I * (2 : ℂ)⁻¹) = -(1 / 4).

  -- The previous step attempted to use `simp` to rearrange, which led to a complicated expression.
  -- We have an expression of the form (a * b) * (c * d) where a = Complex.I, b = (2 : ℂ)⁻¹, c = Complex.I, d = (2 : ℂ)⁻¹.
  -- Since multiplication in Complex is commutative, we can rearrange this product using `mul_mul_mul_comm`: (a * b) * (c * d) = (a * c) * (b * d).
  -- We want to rearrange to (Complex.I * Complex.I) * ((2 : ℂ)⁻¹ * (2 : ℂ)⁻¹).
  -- We use `mul_mul_mul_comm` with a=Complex.I, b=(2 : ℂ)⁻¹, c=Complex.I, d=(2 : ℂ)⁻¹.
  -- The failing rewrite `rw [mul_assoc (Complex.I * Complex.I) (2 : ℂ)⁻¹ (2 : ℂ)⁻¹]` was attempting to rewrite a pattern that was not present in the goal after `simp`.

  -- The previous tactic `rw [inv_mul_inv (2 : ℂ) (2 : ℂ)]` failed. Using `pow_two_inv` is more direct for the pattern x⁻¹ * x⁻¹.
  -- The theorem `pow_two_inv` does not exist. We need to use `pow_two` (or `sq`) followed by `inv_pow`.

  -- The rfl tactic failed because the two sides were not definitionally equal due to coercions and representations.
  -- We use simp to normalize the numerical expressions involving coercions.
  -- -(4 : ℂ)⁻¹ simplifies to Complex.ofRat (-(1/4)).
  -- -(1/4) (which is -( (1/4 : ℚ) : ℂ)) simplifies to Complex.ofRat (-(1/4)).

  -- The goal is now Complex.ofRat (-(1 / 4)) = Complex.ofRat (-(1 / 4)), which is definitionally equal.
  -- The simp tactic successfully closed the goal, making the following `rfl` redundant.
