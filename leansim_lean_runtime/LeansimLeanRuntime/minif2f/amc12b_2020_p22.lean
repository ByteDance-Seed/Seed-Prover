theorem amc12b_2020_p22
  (t : ℝ) :
  ((2^t - 3 * t) * t) / (4^t) ≤ 1 / 12 := by

  -- Step 1: Show that the denominator 4^t is positive. This allows us to rewrite the inequality by multiplying/dividing.
  have h_4t_pos : (4^t : ℝ) > 0 := by
    -- Use the theorem Real.rpow_pos_of_pos which states that x^r > 0 if x > 0.
    apply Real.rpow_pos_of_pos
    -- We need to show that the base, 4, is positive.
    norm_num

  -- Step 2: Rewrite the inequality A/C <= B to A <= B*C by multiplying both sides by C.
  -- Use the theorem div_le_iff which states a/c <= b <-> a <= b*c when c > 0 in an OrderedField.
  rw [div_le_iff h_4t_pos]
  -- Goal: ((2^t : ℝ) - (3 : ℝ) * t) * t ≤ (1 : ℝ) / (12 : ℝ) * (4 : ℝ) ^ t

  -- Step 3: Multiply both sides by 12. Use mul_le_mul_left because 12 > 0.
  -- mul_le_mul_left is an iff theorem: c * a ≤ c * b ↔ a ≤ b when c > 0.
  -- We have a ≤ b (the current goal) and want to rewrite it to 12 * a ≤ 12 * b.
  -- This is the reverse direction (mpr) of the iff `12 * a ≤ 12 * b ↔ a ≤ b`.
  -- The theorem is `mul_le_mul_left_iff`. We need `← mul_le_mul_left_iff h_12_pos`.
  -- The original code uses `mul_le_mul_left` which is `0 < c → (c * a ≤ c * b ↔ a ≤ b)`. Let's stick to that, using the reverse direction of the equivalence.
  have h_12_pos : (12 : ℝ) > 0 := by norm_num
  rw [← mul_le_mul_left h_12_pos]
  -- Goal: 12 * (((2^t : ℝ) - (3 : ℝ) * t) * t) ≤ 12 * ((1 : ℝ) / (12 : ℝ) * (4 : ℝ) ^ t)

  -- Step 4: Simplify the RHS using field_simp.
  -- 12 * (1/12 * 4^t) = (12 * 1/12) * 4^t = 1 * 4^t = 4^t
  have h_rhs_simplify : 12 * ((1 : ℝ) / (12 : ℝ) * (4 : ℝ) ^ t) = (4 : ℝ) ^ t := by
    -- Use field_simp first to handle the division of rational numbers.
    field_simp
    -- The goal was already solved by `field_simp`, so no other tactics are needed.
    done

  rw [h_rhs_simplify]
  -- Goal: 12 * (((2^t : ℝ) - (3 : ℝ) * t) * t) ≤ (4 : ℝ) ^ t

  -- Step 5a: Expand the LHS using ring.
  -- Use ring tactic to expand `12 * ((2^t - 3 * t) * t)` to `12 * 2^t * t - 36 * t^2`.
  -- The previous hypothesis h_lhs_expand had the wrong grouping in its LHS for direct rewrite.
  -- We redefine h_lhs_expand to match the exact grouping in the goal.
  have h_lhs_expand : 12 * (((2^t : ℝ) - (3 : ℝ) * t) * t) = 12 * (2 : ℝ) ^ t * t - (36 : ℝ) * t ^ (2 : ℕ) := by
    -- Use ring tactic to prove this algebraic identity.
    ring

  -- Apply the correct expansion of the LHS.
  -- The previous error occurred because the LHS of the hypothesis h_lhs_expand didn't syntactically match the LHS of the goal due to different grouping of terms.
  -- By adjusting the hypothesis definition to match the exact grouping in the goal, the rewrite now succeeds.
  rw [h_lhs_expand]
  -- Goal: 12 * (2 : ℝ) ^ t * t - (36 : ℝ) * t ^ (2 : ℕ) ≤ (4 : ℝ) ^ t

  -- Apply the definition of squaring `sq` to the term `t ^ (2 : ℕ)` on the LHS of the inequality, rewriting it as `t * t`. This is done to match the form used later in the `h_perfect_square` hypothesis.
  -- The previous code applied this after the `Real.le_iff_sub_nonneg` step, but it makes more sense to do it before standardizing terms.
  rw [sq (t : ℝ)]
  -- Goal: (12 : ℝ) * (2 : ℝ) ^ t * t - (36 : ℝ) * (t * t) ≤ (4 : ℝ) ^ t

  -- Step 5b: Rearrange the inequality to have 0 on one side.
  -- Use the theorem le_iff_sub_nonneg which states a ≤ b ↔ 0 ≤ b - a for real numbers (as ℝ is an AddGroup and PartialOrder).
  -- The goal is a ≤ b, where a = (12 : ℝ) * (2 : ℝ) ^ t * t - (36 : ℝ) * (t * t) and b = (4 : ℝ) ^ t.
  -- We want to change the goal to 0 ≤ b - a.
  -- The theorem `le_iff_sub_nonneg` is `a ≤ b ↔ 0 ≤ b - a`. We apply this equivalence directly using `rw`.
  -- The previous error 'unknown constant 'le_sub_iff_left'' indicates that the theorem `le_sub_iff_left` was not the correct theorem name or was not in scope. The correct theorem for `a ≤ b ↔ 0 ≤ b - a` in an ordered additive group is `le_iff_sub_nonneg`.
  -- The tactic `rw [le_iff_sub_nonneg]` failed. Although `le_iff_sub_nonneg` is an `iff`, `rw` sometimes struggles with complex terms.
  -- We use the `suffices` tactic instead. We state that it suffices to prove `0 ≤ b - a` (where a and b are the terms in the current goal) to prove the current goal `a ≤ b`.
  -- The `by` block then proves the original goal `a ≤ b` from the hypothesis `h_nonneg_sub : 0 ≤ b - a` using the reverse implication of `le_iff_sub_nonneg`, which is `le_iff_sub_nonneg.mpr`.
  suffices h_nonneg_sub : 0 ≤ (4 : ℝ) ^ t - ((12 : ℝ) * (2 : ℝ) ^ t * t - (36 : ℝ) * (t * t)) by
    -- We have the hypothesis `h_nonneg_sub : 0 ≤ B - A`.
    -- The original goal is `A ≤ B`.
    -- We use `le_of_sub_nonneg` which proves `b ≤ a` from `0 ≤ a - b`.
    -- Here, `a` is `(4 : ℝ) ^ t` and `b` is `(12 : ℝ) * (2 : ℝ) ^ t * t - (36 : ℝ) * (t * t)`.
    -- The goal is `b ≤ a`. We have the hypothesis `h_nonneg_sub : 0 ≤ a - b`.
    -- Apply the lemma `le_of_sub_nonneg` providing the hypothesis `h_nonneg_sub`.
    -- -- The previous code used `apply Real.le_iff_sub_nonneg.mpr` which resulted in an "unknown constant" error.
    -- -- We use `le_of_sub_nonneg` as suggested by the hints, which provides the same implication.
    apply le_of_sub_nonneg h_nonneg_sub
    -- The goal A ≤ B is now discharged.

  -- Goal: 0 ≤ (4 : ℝ) ^ t - ((12 : ℝ) * (2 : ℝ) ^ t * t - (36 : ℝ) * (t * t))

  -- Step 6: Expand and rearrange the subtraction on the LHS (previously RHS).
  -- The goal is now 0 ≤ RHS, where RHS is `(4^t) - (12 * 2^t * t - 36 * t*t)`.
  -- We expand the subtraction: `(4^t) - (A - B) = (4^t) - A + B`.
  -- This results in `(4^t) - 12 * 2^t * t + 36 * t*t`.
  -- We use the hypothesis `h_expand_rearrange` for this identity, which uses `t*t`.
  -- We correct the hypothesis `h_expand_rearrange` to match the current goal's structure, using `t*t`.
  have h_expand_rearrange : (4^t : ℝ) - (12 * (2 : ℝ) ^ t * t - 36 * (t * t)) = (4^t : ℝ) - 12 * t * (2 : ℝ) ^ t + 36 * (t * t) := by
    -- Use ring_nf tactic to simplify the expression algebraically.
    ring_nf
    -- The previous `rfl` was redundant as `ring_nf` already proved the equality.

  -- Apply the simplification to the term on the RHS of the 0 ≤ inequality.
  rw [h_expand_rearrange]
  -- Goal: 0 ≤ (4 : ℝ) ^ t - 12 * t * (2 : ℝ) ^ t + 36 * (t * t)

  -- Step 7: Rewrite 4^t as (2^t)^2.
  -- We want to show (4^t : ℝ) = (2^t : ℝ) ^ 2.
  -- (2^t : ℝ)^2 is definitionally (2^t : ℝ) * (2^t : ℝ) for Real numbers.
  -- 4^t = (2*2)^t. For non-negative bases, (x*y)^a = x^a * y^a. Base 2 is non-negative.
  -- So (2*2)^t = 2^t * 2^t.
  have h_4t_pow_two : (4^t : ℝ) = (2^t : ℝ) ^ 2 := by
    -- Goal: (4^t : ℝ) = (2^t : ℝ) ^ 2
    -- Rewrite 4 as 2*2
    rw [show (4 : ℝ) = (2 * 2 : ℝ) by norm_num]
    -- Goal: (2 * 2 : ℝ) ^ t = (2^t : ℝ) ^ 2
    -- Apply Real.mul_rpow to LHS: (2*2)^t = 2^t * 2^t
    -- Need 0 <= 2 and 0 <= 2, which are true by norm_num.
    -- -- The previous line had the wrong syntax for providing arguments to Real.mul_rpow in a rewrite.
    -- -- The syntax for `rw [theorem arg1 arg2 ...]` requires the arguments to be the premises of the theorem.
    -- -- The theorem Real.mul_rpow takes proofs of `0 ≤ x` and `0 ≤ y` as arguments. Here x=2 and y=2.
    have h2_pos : (0 : ℝ) ≤ 2 := by norm_num
    rw [Real.mul_rpow h2_pos h2_pos]
    -- Goal: (2 : ℝ) ^ t * (2 : ℝ) ^ t = (2^t : ℝ) ^ 2
    -- Rewrite RHS using definition of sq (x^2 = x*x)
    rw [sq ((2:ℝ)^t)]
    -- Goal: (2 : ℝ) ^ t * (2 : ℝ) ^ t = (2 : ℝ) ^ t * (2 : ℝ) ^ t
    -- The goal is definitionally equal by rfl, but ring_nf can also prove this equality.
    -- -- Removed redundant rfl tactic as the goal was already solved by the previous rewrite.

  -- Substitute 4^t with (2^t)^2 in the inequality.
  rw [h_4t_pow_two]
  -- Goal: 0 ≤ (2 : ℝ) ^ t ^ 2 - 12 * t * (2 : ℝ) ^ t + 36 * (t * t)

  -- Step 8: Recognize the expression on the RHS of 0 ≤ as a perfect square: ((2^t : ℝ) - 6 * t) ^ 2.
  -- Expand ((2^t - 6t)^2) using (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2.
  -- ((2^t) - 6t)^2 = (2^t)^2 - 2 * (2^t) * (6t) + (6t)^2
  --              = (2^t)^2 - 12 * (2^t) * t + 36 * t^2
  --              = (2^t)^2 - 12 * t * 2^t + 36 * t*t (by commutativity of multiplication and definition of t*t)
  -- This identity is definitionally true in Lean after unfolding definitions like squaring.
  -- The hypothesis `h_perfect_square` previously used `t^(2:ℕ)`. The goal now has `t * t` after applying `rw [sq]`. The definition of `h_perfect_square` must match this, which it does in the provided code.
  have h_perfect_square : (2^t : ℝ) ^ 2 - 12 * t * (2^t : ℝ) + 36 * (t * t) = ((2^t : ℝ) - 6 * t) ^ 2 := by
    ring_nf -- Use ring_nf to expand the RHS and confirm equality.
    -- -- The previous line `rfl` was redundant as `ring_nf` already solved the goal.

  -- Substitute the RHS expression with its perfect square form.
  rw [h_perfect_square]
  -- Goal: 0 ≤ ((2^t : ℝ) - 6 * t) ^ 2

  -- Step 9: The goal is now to prove that the square of a real number is non-negative, rewritten as 0 ≤ x^2.
  -- Use the theorem sq_nonneg which states that x^2 ≥ 0 for any real number x.
  -- The current goal is 0 ≤ x^2. This is exactly what sq_nonneg proves when applied.
  apply sq_nonneg ((2^t : ℝ) - 6 * t)

  -- The proof is complete.
