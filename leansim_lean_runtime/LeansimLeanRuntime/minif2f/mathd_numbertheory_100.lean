  -- We are given gcd(n, 40) = 10 and lcm(n, 40) = 280.
  -- We know that for any natural numbers a and b, gcd(a, b) * lcm(a, b) = a * b.
  -- This is given by the theorem Nat.gcd_mul_lcm.
  -- The original code had := by have ... on the same line, which caused a syntax error according to the message.
  -- We split it so that the first tactic starts on a new line after := by.
  have h_mul : Nat.gcd n 40 * Nat.lcm n 40 = n * 40 := Nat.gcd_mul_lcm n 40
  -- Substitute the given values for gcd and lcm using hypotheses h₁ and h₂.

  -- The equation is now 10 * 280 = n * 40.

  -- The equation is now 2800 = n * 40.
  -- We want to show n = 70. Let's calculate the product 70 * 40 to compare.
  have h_70_prod : 70 * 40 = 2800 := by norm_num
  -- We have 2800 = n * 40 and 70 * 40 = 2800.
  -- By substituting the second equation into the first (or by transitivity of equality),
  -- we get 70 * 40 = n * 40.
  rw [← h_70_prod] at h_mul
  -- The equation is now 70 * 40 = n * 40.
  -- We can cancel 40 from both sides of the equation because 40 is positive.
  -- The theorem Nat.eq_of_mul_eq_mul_right requires a proof that the term being cancelled is positive (0 < c).
  have h_40_pos : 0 < 40 := by norm_num
  -- The theorem Nat.eq_of_mul_eq_mul_right states that if a * c = b * c and 0 < c, then a = b.
  -- Applying this theorem with a=70, b=n, c=40 gives 70 = n.
  -- The previous application using `@` resulted in a type mismatch, suggesting issues with type inference.
  -- We will apply the theorem using the `apply` tactic within a `have` block to make the hypotheses explicit.

  -- We want to show n = 70. We will prove the equivalent statement 70 = n first.
  have h_70_eq_n : 70 = n := by
    -- Apply the theorem Nat.eq_of_mul_eq_mul_right.
    -- This generates two subgoals corresponding to the theorem's hypotheses:
    -- 1) 0 < 40 (this corresponds to `0 < c`)
    -- 2) 70 * 40 = n * 40 (this corresponds to `a * c = b * c`)
    apply Nat.eq_of_mul_eq_mul_right
    -- The error message indicated that the first expected type was `0 < ?m`.
    -- This means the first subgoal generated by `apply` is `0 < 40`.
    -- We need to provide the proof for `0 < 40` first, which is `h_40_pos`.
    exact h_40_pos
    -- The second subgoal is `70 * 40 = n * 40`, which is `h_mul`.
    exact h_mul

  -- We have successfully derived 70 = n (stored as h_70_eq_n).
  -- The goal is n = 70. Use the symmetry of equality (`Eq.symm`) to prove the goal from h_70_eq_n.
