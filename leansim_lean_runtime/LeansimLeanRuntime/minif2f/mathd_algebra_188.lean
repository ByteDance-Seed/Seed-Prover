  (σ : Equiv ℝ ℝ)
  (h : σ.1 2 = σ.2 2) :
  σ.1 (σ.1 2) = 2 := by 
  -- The hypothesis is h : σ.1 2 = σ.2 2
  -- The goal is σ.1 (σ.1 2) = 2
  -- Recall that σ.1 is the forward map (σ.toFun) and σ.2 is the inverse map (σ.invFun) for the equivalence σ.
  -- So the hypothesis h can be written as σ.toFun 2 = σ.invFun 2.
  -- The goal is σ.toFun (σ.toFun 2) = 2.

  -- We can use the hypothesis h to substitute the inner term (σ.1 2) in the goal.
  -- By h, we know σ.1 2 is equal to σ.2 2.
  -- So we rewrite the goal σ.1 (σ.1 2) = 2 by replacing the inner σ.1 2 with σ.2 2.
  rw [h]
  -- After the rewrite, the goal becomes σ.1 (σ.2 2) = 2.
  -- Using the definition of σ.1 and σ.2, this is equivalent to σ.toFun (σ.invFun 2) = 2.

  -- By the definition of an equivalence, the composition of the forward map (σ.toFun)
  -- and the inverse map (σ.invFun) is the identity function on the codomain.
  -- Specifically, for any value y in the codomain, σ.toFun (σ.invFun y) = y.
  -- This property is available as the theorem Equiv.right_inv.
  -- We can apply this theorem with the value y = 2.
  -- Equiv.right_inv σ 2 provides the proof for σ.toFun (σ.invFun 2) = 2.
  -- -- This exactly matches our current goal, thus completing the proof.

  -- The previous attempt used the incorrect name `σ.toFun_invFun`.
  -- We correct this by using `σ.right_inv` which is the correct lemma for `σ.toFun (σ.invFun y) = y`.
