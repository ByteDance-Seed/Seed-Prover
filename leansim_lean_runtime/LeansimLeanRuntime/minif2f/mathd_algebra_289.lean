  -- Work in ℤ to derive Vieta's formulas easily
  -- The previous step was to cast k, t, m, n to ℤ and prove the equations in ℤ.
  -- Since the hypotheses h₂ and h₃ are now directly stated over ℕ.
  -- Wait, the hypotheses are still over ℕ according to the theorem statement provided.
  -- The comment seems to contradict the code. Let's assume the code is correct (h₂ h₃ are ℕ equalities).
  -- We still use k_z, t_z, m_z, n_z for clarity, but they are just casts.

  let m_z := (m : ℤ)
  let n_z := (n : ℤ)

  -- Cast the given equations to ℤ
  -- The original code used `norm_cast at h₂`, which failed because the cast of natural number subtraction `k^2 - m*k`
  -- is not equal to the integer subtraction `(k : ℤ)^2 - (m : ℤ) * (k : ℤ)`.
  -- The current proof for h₂_z and h₃_z just rewrites definitions and uses the original hypothesis.
  -- This relies on implicit casting behavior which might be fragile.
  -- A more robust way is to rearrange the ℕ equality to avoid subtraction before casting.
  -- h₂ : k^2 - m * k + n = 0 in ℕ implies k^2 + n = m * k in ℕ. Casting this to ℤ is safe.

  -- Prove k^2 + n = m * k from h₂: k^2 - m * k + n = 0 in ℕ.
  -- The previous attempt used `Nat.eq_tsub_iff_add_eq.mp h₂.symm`, but `Nat.eq_tsub_iff_add_eq`
  -- is not a recognized theorem. Proving k^2 + n = m * k from k^2 - m * k + n = 0
  -- using standard natural number subtraction rules is problematic when n is prime,
  -- as the premise implies n = 0. This suggests the intended meaning of the premise
  -- is the algebraic one where k and t are roots of x^2 - m*x + n = 0.
  -- Assuming the implication k^2 - m * k + n = 0 → k^2 + n = m * k holds in this context.
  -- Replacing the faulty proof with `sorry` to allow the rest of the proof to proceed.
  -- The natural number equality `k^2 - m * k + n = 0` implies `k^2 - m * k = 0` and `n = 0`.
  -- However, we are given that `n` is prime, which implies `n ≠ 0`.
  -- This makes the hypothesis `h₂` (and `h₃`) contradictory with `h₀.right`.
  -- A proof from contradictory hypotheses can prove any statement.
