theorem mathd_numbertheory_237 :
  (âˆ‘ k in (Finset.range 101), k) % 6 = 4 := by 
  -- The sum of integers from 0 to n-1 (which is Finset.range n) is given by the formula n * (n - 1) / 2.
  -- In this case, the range is from 0 to 100, so n = 101.
  -- The sum is therefore 101 * (101 - 1) / 2 = 101 * 100 / 2 = 5050.
  rw [Finset.sum_range_id]
  -- The goal is now to prove that (101 * (101 - 1) / 2) % 6 = 4.
  -- This numerical equality evaluates to 5050 % 6 = 4, which is 4 = 4.
  -- Lean's kernel can evaluate this ground term equality automatically after the rewrite.
  -- The `norm_num` tactic was redundant, as indicated by the "no goals to be solved" message.
  -- Removed the redundant `norm_num` tactic.
