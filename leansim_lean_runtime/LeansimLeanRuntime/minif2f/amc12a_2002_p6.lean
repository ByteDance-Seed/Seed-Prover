  (n : ℕ)
  (h₀ : 0 < n) :
  ∃ m, (m > n ∧ ∃ p, m * p ≤ m + p) := by

  -- We are looking for a natural number m such that m > n and there exists an integer p satisfying the inequality m * p ≤ m + p.
  -- Lean will coerce m to an integer for these operations. The inequality is effectively (m : ℤ) * p ≤ (m : ℤ) + p.

  -- This inequality can be algebraically manipulated for integers m' and p'.
  -- m' * p' ≤ m' + p'
  -- m' * p' - m' - p' ≤ 0
  -- m' * p' - m' - p' + 1 ≤ 1
  -- (m' - 1) * (p' - 1) ≤ 1

  -- So the condition `∃ p : ℤ, m * p ≤ m + p` (interpreted as ∃ p : ℤ, (m : ℤ) * p ≤ (m : ℤ) + p) is equivalent to `∃ p : ℤ, ((m : ℤ) - 1) * (p - 1) ≤ 1`.

  -- Let's choose a value for m that is a natural number greater than n.
  -- A simple choice is m = n + 1.
  -- Since n is a natural number, n + 1 is a natural number.
  -- We propose n + 1 as the required natural number m.
  use n + 1

  -- The goal is now (n + 1 > n) AND (∃ p : ℕ, (n + 1) * p ≤ (n + 1) + p).
  -- We split the conjunction into two subgoals.
  constructor

  -- Goal 1: Prove (n + 1) > n.
  -- This is a direct inequality between natural numbers.
  linarith -- The `linarith` tactic can directly prove `n + 1 > n` for natural numbers.

  -- Goal 2: Prove ∃ p : ℕ, ((n + 1) : ℕ) * p ≤ ((n + 1) : ℕ) + p.
  -- The problem statement uses `∃ p, m * p ≤ m + p`. Since m is a natural number here,
  -- Lean infers that p should also be a natural number for the multiplication and addition to be defined as natural number operations.
  -- The previous error occurred because we tried to apply an equivalence about integers `p` (`h_equiv_int`) to a goal involving natural numbers `p`.
  -- We need an equivalence that relates the existence of a natural number `p` satisfying the natural number inequality to the equivalent integer inequality involving the coerced natural number `p`.

  -- We first prove the equivalence for integers m' and p'.

      -- This inequality is equivalent to m_int * p'int - m_int - p_int ≤ 0.
      -- This inequality is equivalent to m_int * p_int ≤ m_int + p_int, which is the hypothesis h_le.
      -- The steps involve only linear operations, so `linarith` can prove this.

    . intro h_le -- (m_int - 1) * (p_int - 1) ≤ 1
      -- We want to prove m_int * p_int ≤ m_int + p_int.

      -- This inequality is equivalent to m_int * p_int - m_int - p_int ≤ 0.
      -- This inequality is equivalent to m'int * p'int ≤ m'int + p'int, which is the goal.
      -- The steps involve only linear operations, so `linarith` can prove this.
      linarith [h_le]

  -- Now, we connect the natural number existential goal to the integer equivalence.
  -- The goal is `∃ p_nat : ℕ, (n + 1) * p_nat ≤ (n + 1) + p_nat`. Let m_nat = n + 1.
  -- The natural number inequality `m_nat * p_nat ≤ m_nat + p_nat` is equivalent to the integer inequality `(m_nat : ℤ) * (p_nat : ℤ) ≤ (m_nat : ℤ) + (p_nat : ℤ)`.
  -- Let m_int = (m_nat : ℤ) and p_int = (p_nat : ℤ). The integer inequality is `m_int * p_int ≤ m_int + p_int`.
  -- By `h_equiv_int m_int p_int`, this is equivalent to `(m_int - 1) * (p_int - 1) ≤ 1`.
  -- Substituting back, this is `(((m_nat) : ℤ) - 1) * (((p_nat) : ℤ) - 1) ≤ 1`.
  -- So the goal `∃ p_nat : ℕ, m_nat * p_nat ≤ m_nat + p_nat` is equivalent to `∃ p_nat : ℕ, (((m_nat) : ℤ) - 1) * (((p_nat) : ℤ) - 1) ≤ 1`.
