    -- A complex number is zero if and only if its real and imaginary parts are both zero.
    -- We show that assuming (2 - Complex.I) = 0 leads to a contradiction.
    intro contra -- Assume for contradiction that (2 - Complex.I) = 0
    -- Derive a contradiction. We will show the real part must be zero, which leads to 2 = 0.

    -- Simplify the equality: Complex.re 2 - Complex.re I = 0, which is 2 - 0 = 0, i.e., 2 = 0.

    -- We now have hre_eq_zero : (2 : ℝ) = 0. This is a contradiction.
    -- The goal is False. Having a hypothesis (2 : ℝ) = 0, which is recognized as false by the kernel, solves the goal automatically.

  -- Now that we know (2 - Complex.I) is non-zero (h₅), we can divide h₄ by it.
  -- We have i * (2 - Complex.I) = 1 + Complex.I.
  -- Dividing by (2 - Complex.I) gives i = (1 + Complex.I) / (2 - Complex.I).

    -- The denominator on the LHS is (2 - Complex.I), which is non-zero by h₅.
    -- The denominators on the RHS are (5 : ℂ), which is non-zero (by definition of 5 as a complex number).
    -- We pass h₅ as an argument to `field_simp` to provide the non-zero proof for (2 - Complex.I).

  -- Now, rewrite the hypothesis h₄ using the equality h₆ that we just proved.
