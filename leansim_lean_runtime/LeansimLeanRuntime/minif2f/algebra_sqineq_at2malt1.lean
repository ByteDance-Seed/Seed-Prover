  (a : ℝ) :
  a * (2 - a) ≤ 1 := by 
  -- The goal is a * (2 - a) ≤ 1.
  -- We want to show that the difference between the right side and the left side is non-negative.
  -- That is, 1 - (a * (2 - a)) ≥ 0.
  -- The theorem `sub_nonneg_iff_le` states `0 ≤ b - a ↔ a ≤ b` for types with an ordered additive group structure, which applies to ℝ.
  -- We want to transform the goal `a ≤ b` (where a is `a * (2 - a)` and b is `1`) using the reverse implication (mpr) of this equivalence.

  -- Simplify the left side of the inequality first so that the structure is clear for the next step.
  -- The ring_nf tactic simplifies the goal from a * (2 - a) ≤ 1 to (a * (2 : ℝ) - a ^ (2 : ℕ)) ≤ 1.
  ring_nf
  -- Goal: a * (2 : ℝ) - a ^ (2 : ℕ) ≤ 1

  -- The previous attempt used `apply le_iff_sub_nonneg`, which resulted in an "unknown identifier" error.
  -- Instead of using the equivalence `le_iff_sub_nonneg`, we will directly prove that the difference between the right side and the left side is non-negative (i.e., 1 - (a * (2 - a)) ≥ 0), and then use the implication `0 ≤ b - a → a ≤ b`, which is provided by the theorem `le_of_sub_nonneg`.

  -- Let's prove that the difference is non-negative.
  -- The expression 1 - (-(a^2) + 2*a) simplifies to (a-1)^2.
  -- We prove 0 ≤ 1 - (-(a^2) + 2*a)
  have h_sub_nonneg : 0 ≤ 1 - (-(a ^ 2) + 2 * a) := by
    -- The expression is 1 - (-(a ^ 2) + 2 * a) which simplifies to 1 + a^2 - 2*a.
    -- This is equal to (a - 1)^2.
    have h_simp : 1 - (-(a ^ 2) + 2 * a) = (a - 1)^2 := by ring
    -- Rewrite the inequality using the simplified expression.
    rw [h_simp]
    -- Goal: 0 ≤ (a - 1)^2
    -- The square of any real number is non-negative.
    -- The theorem `sq_nonneg x` states that x^2 ≥ 0.
    apply sq_nonneg (a - 1)
    -- The subgoal 0 ≤ (a - 1)^2 is now proven.
  -- h_sub_nonneg : 0 ≤ 1 - (-(a ^ 2) + 2 * a)

  -- Now use the theorem `le_of_sub_nonneg` which states `0 ≤ b - a → a ≤ b`.
  -- Our current goal (after ring_nf) is `a * (2 : ℝ) - a ^ (2 : ℕ) ≤ 1`.
  -- The hypothesis `h_sub_nonneg` is `0 ≤ 1 - (-(a ^ 2) + 2 * a)`.
  -- Applying `le_of_sub_nonneg` to `h_sub_nonneg` proves `-(a ^ 2) + 2 * a ≤ 1`.
  -- To make the current goal `a * (2 : ℝ) - a ^ (2 : ℕ) ≤ 1` match this conclusion `-(a ^ 2) + 2 * a ≤ 1`, we need to rewrite the left side of the goal.
  -- We need to show that `a * (2 : ℝ) - a ^ (2 : ℕ)` is equal to `-(a ^ (2 : ℕ)) + (2 : ℝ) * a`.
  -- We can prove this equality using `ring`.
  -- -- The tactic `ring` can prove `a * (2 : ℝ) - a ^ (2 : ℕ) = (2 : ℝ) * a - a ^ (2 : ℕ)`
  -- -- And it can prove `(2 : ℝ) * a - a ^ (2 : ℕ) = -(a ^ (2 : ℕ)) + (2 : ℝ) * a`
  -- -- So they are equal.
  have h_goal_eq : a * (2 : ℝ) - a ^ (2 : ℕ) = -(a ^ (2 : ℕ)) + (2 : ℝ) * a := by ring
  -- Rewrite the goal using this equality.
  -- -- The previous error occurred because the goal's syntactic form `a * (2 : ℝ) - a ^ (2 : ℕ) ≤ (1 : ℝ)` did not match the expected form `-(a ^ 2) + (2 : ℝ) * a ≤ (1 : ℝ)` required by `apply le_of_sub_nonneg h_sub_nonneg`.
  -- -- Rewriting the goal makes it match the expected form.
  rw [h_goal_eq]
  -- Goal is now `-(a ^ (2 : ℕ)) + (2 : ℝ) * a ≤ (1 : ℝ)`

  -- Now the goal `-(a ^ (2 : ℕ)) + (2 : ℝ) * a ≤ (1 : ℝ)` syntactically matches the conclusion of `le_of_sub_nonneg h_sub_nonneg`.
  apply le_of_sub_nonneg h_sub_nonneg
  -- The main goal is now proven.
