  -- The original code attempted to use an unknown identifier `h_x_eq_div_mul` and `h_y_mul_10_eq_x`.
  -- This hypothesis did not exist in the context.
  -- We need to start by using the given hypotheses `h₂ : x / 10 = y` and `h₁ : 10 ∣ x`
  -- to derive a relationship between x and y, specifically `x = 10 * y`.
  -- The theorem `Nat.div_eq_iff_eq_mul_left` states that for `b > 0`, `a / b = c ↔ a = b * c`.
  -- We apply this theorem with `a = x`, `b = 10`, and `c = y`.
  -- We first need to prove that `0 < 10`. `by norm_num` proves this.
  -- `Nat.div_eq_iff_eq_mul_left (by norm_num : 0 < 10) h₁` gives the equivalence `x / 10 = y ↔ x = y * 10`.
  -- We have the hypothesis `h₂ : x / 10 = y`, which is the left side of the equivalence.
  -- Applying `.mp h₂` gives the right side, `x = y * 10`.
  -- The desired type in the `have` statement is `x = 10 * y`.
  -- We need to use the commutativity of multiplication (`Nat.mul_comm`) to rewrite `y * 10` to `10 * y`.

    -- -- The error message indicates that the result of `(Nat.div_eq_iff_eq_mul_left (by norm_num : 0 < 10) h₁).mp h₂` is `x = y * 10`, not `x = 10 * y`.

  -- and then use this hypothesis to rewrite the equation `h_y_eq_div : y = 17402 / 11` into `y = 1582`.

  -- The Lean kernel can evaluate the subtraction on the left side.
  -- The goal becomes `(14238 : ℤ) = (14238 : ℤ)`.
  -- This is an equality between definitionally equal terms, which is solved by `rfl`.
