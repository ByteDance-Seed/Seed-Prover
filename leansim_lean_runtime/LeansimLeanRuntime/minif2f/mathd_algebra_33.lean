  -- We are given the equations 2*x = 5*y (h₁) and 7*y = 10*z (h₂).
  -- We want to prove that z / x = 7 / 25, given x ≠ 0 (h₀).

  -- Step 1: Express y in terms of x from the equation h₁.
  -- 2 * x = 5 * y  =>  y = (2 * x) / 5

    -- The goal simplifies to y = y, which is trivially true.
    -- -- The goal was already solved by field_simp, so rfl is redundant.
    -- rfl

  -- Step 2: Express z in terms of y from the equation h₂.
  -- 7 * y = 10 * z  =>  z = (7 * y) / 10
  -- We need to divide by 10. Ensure 10 is non-zero.

    -- Using eq_div_iff_mul_eq, the goal is equivalent to z * 10 = 7 * y, given 10 ≠ 0.
    -- We use the theorem `eq_div_iff_mul_eq` to rewrite the goal `z = (7 * y) / 10`
    -- into the equivalent form `z * 10 = 7 * y`, provided that the denominator (10) is non-zero.

  -- Step 3: Substitute the expression for y (h_y_eq) into the equation for z (h_z_eq_in_y).

  -- Step 4: Simplify the right side of the equation for z in terms of x.
  -- (7 * ((2 * x) / 5)) / 10 = (7/25) * x
  -- We can use `field_simp` to apply field properties and `norm_num` to evaluate constants.

  -- Step 5: Apply the simplified right side to the equation for z.
  -- z = (7 * ((2 * x) / 5)) / 10  becomes z = (7/25) * x
  have h_z_eq_simplified : z = (7/25 : ℝ) * x := by

  -- Step 6: The goal is z / x = 7 / 25.
  -- We have derived z = (7/25) * x and we are given h₀ : x ≠ 0.
  -- Substitute the expression for z into the goal.
  rw [h_z_eq_simplified]
  -- The goal is now ((7/25 : ℝ) * x) / x = 7/25.

  -- Step 7: Simplify the left side using field properties, specifically the property that (a*b)/b = a when b ≠ 0.
  -- Since x ≠ 0 (h₀), ((7/25 : ℝ) * x) / x simplifies using field_simp.
  -- Use field_simp [h₀] which simplifies the expression and clears denominators.
  field_simp [h₀]
  -- The goal is now (7 : ℝ) * x * (25 : ℝ) = (7 : ℝ) * ((25 : ℝ) * x).

  -- Step 8: Close the goal using ring tactic.
  -- The equality is now in a form that ring can solve.
  -- The message indicates the previous step `field_simp [h₀]` did not solve the goal entirely,
  -- leaving the expression `(7 : ℝ) * x * (25 : ℝ) = (7 : ℝ) * ((25 : ℝ) * x)`.
  -- This equality can be proven by the `ring` tactic.
