  p^(2 * n) * (q^m) = 12^(m * n) := by

  -- The goal is to prove p^(2n) * q^m = 12^(mn) given p = 2^m and q = 3^n.
  -- Substitute p and q using the given hypotheses.
  rw [h₀, h₁]
  -- The goal becomes (2^m)^(2*n) * (3^n)^m = 12^(m * n)

  -- Use the power rule (x^y)^z = x^(y*z) for real numbers.
  -- This corresponds to the theorem `rpow_mul : x ^ (y * z) = (x ^ y) ^ z`.
  -- We apply the theorem from right to left using `← rpow_mul`.
  -- This requires the base to be non-negative. 2 and 3 are non-negative.

  have h_pos3 : (0 : ℝ) ≤ 3 := by norm_num
  rw [← rpow_mul h_pos2, ← rpow_mul h_pos3]
  -- The goal becomes 2^(m * (2*n)) * 3^(n * m) = 12^(m * n)

  -- Rewrite the base 12 on the right side as 2^2 * 3.
  have h12 : (12 : ℝ) = (2^2 : ℝ) * (3 : ℝ) := by norm_num
  rw [h12]
  -- The goal becomes 2^(m * (2*n)) * 3^(n * m) = ((2^2) * 3)^(m * n)

  -- Use the power rule (x*y)^z = x^z * y^z for real numbers.
  -- This corresponds to the theorem `mul_rpow : (x * y) ^ z = x ^ z * y ^ z`.
  -- This requires the bases x and y to be non-negative. 2^2 and 3 are non-negative.
  have h_pos4 : (0 : ℝ) ≤ (2^2 : ℝ) := by norm_num -- 2^2 = 4 >= 0
  rw [mul_rpow h_pos4 h_pos3]
  -- The goal becomes 2^(m * (2*n)) * 3^(n * m) = (2^2)^(m * n) * 3^(m * n)

  -- Use the power rule (x^n)^y = x^(n*y) on the first term of the right side, where n is a natural number.
  -- (2^2)^(m * n) = 2^(2 * (m * n)). Requires base 2 >= 0, which is h_pos2.
  -- The term (2^2) is interpreted as (2:ℝ)^(2:ℕ). The exponent (m*n) is ℝ.
  -- This corresponds to the theorem `Real.rpow_natCast_mul : x ^ (n * z) = (x ^ n) ^ z` (reordered slightly from the hint)
  -- We apply this theorem from right to left.
  -- The previous theorem `Real.rpow_nat_cast_rpow` was not found. We use `Real.rpow_natCast_mul` instead.
  -- The type mismatch occurs because the `have` declaration expects `((2 : ℝ) ^ (2 : ℕ)) ^ (m * n) = (2 : ℝ) ^ ((2 : ℕ) * (m * n))`,
  -- but `Real.rpow_natCast_mul` proves the reverse direction. We need to use symmetry (`.symm`).

  -- Now rewrite the term on the RHS of the goal using the explicit equality.
  -- The 'at rhs' clause was causing an error because 'rhs' is not a valid identifier for the target.
  -- Removing 'at rhs' applies the rewrite to the goal's target by default.

  -- The goal becomes (2 : ℝ) ^ (m * (2*n)) * (3 : ℝ) ^ (n * m) = (2 : ℝ) ^ ((2 : ℕ) * (m * n)) * (3 : ℝ) ^ (m * n)

  -- The bases match on both sides. The goal is now of the form A * B = C * D
  -- where A = 2^(m * (2*n)), B = 3^(n * m), C = 2^((2:ℕ) * (m * n)), D = 3^(m * n).
  -- We need to show A = C and B = D.
  -- Since the bases (2 and 3) are positive, rpow is injective with respect to the exponent.
  -- We can use `congr 1` to break down the goal `A * B = C * D` into `A = C` and `B = D`.
  congr 1
  -- We get two subgoals:
  -- Subgoal 1: rpow 2 (m * (2 * n)) = rpow 2 ((2 : ℕ) * (m * n))
  -- Subgoal 2: rpow 3 (n * m) = rpow 3 (m * n)

  -- Solve Subgoal 1: `rpow 2 (m * (2 * n)) = rpow 2 ((2 : ℕ) * (m * n))`
  -- This equality holds if the exponents are equal because the base 2 is positive and not 1.
  -- We focus on proving the equality of the exponents using `congr 1`.
  congr 1 -- Focus on the exponent: m * (2 * n) = (2 : ℕ) * (m * n)
  -- Goal: m * (2 * n) = (2 : ℕ) * (m * n)
  -- This is a simple algebraic equality for real numbers. The left side is `m * (2:ℝ) * n` and the right side is `(2:ℝ) * (m * n)`.
  ring -- The `ring` tactic proves this algebraic equality using properties of real numbers.
  -- Subgoal 1 is solved.

  -- Solve Subgoal 2: `rpow 3 (n * m) = rpow 3 (m * n)`
  -- This equality holds if the exponents are equal because the base 3 is positive and not 1.
  -- We focus on proving the equality of the exponents using `congr 1`.
  congr 1 -- Focus on the exponent: n * m = m * n
  -- Goal: n * m = m * n
  -- This is a simple algebraic equality for real numbers (commutativity).
  ring -- The `ring` tactic proves this algebraic equality.
  -- Subgoal 2 is solved.

  -- Both subgoals are solved, so the main goal is proved.
