  (n : ℕ) :
  11 ∣ (10^n - (-1 : ℤ)^n) := by 
 
  -- The base case is n = 0.
  induction n with
  | zero =>
    -- We need to show 11 ∣ (10^0 - (-1 : ℤ)^0).
    -- 10^0 = 1 and (-1)^0 = 1.
    -- So we need to show 11 ∣ (1 - 1), which is 11 ∣ 0.
    simp -- simplifies 10^0 to 1, (-1 : ℤ)^0 to 1, and 1 - 1 to 0. Goal is 11 ∣ 0.
    -- -- The previous `norm_num` tactic was reported as having "no goals to be solved", suggesting it was redundant after `simp`. We remove it.
    -- norm_num -- This line caused the error "no goals to be solved"
    -- We are left with the goal `11 ∣ 0`, which is true for any integer.
    -- apply dvd_zero -- Apply the theorem that any integer divides 0.
    -- -- The line `apply dvd_zero` was redundant because `simp` already solved the goal `11 ∣ 0` by applying the simp lemma `dvd_zero`. We remove the redundant line.
  | succ k ih =>
    -- The induction step assumes that 11 divides (10^k - (-1 : ℤ)^k) for some k (this is ih).
    -- We need to prove that 11 divides (10^(k+1) - (-1 : ℤ)^(k+1)).
    -- The induction hypothesis `ih` is `11 ∣ (10^k - (-1 : ℤ)^k)`.
    -- The target expression is `10^(k+1) - (-1 : ℤ)^(k+1)`.
    -- We can rewrite the target expression:
    -- 10^(k+1) - (-1 : ℤ)^(k+1) = 10 * 10^k - (-1) * (-1)^k
    --                       = 10 * 10^k + (-1)^k
    -- We want to relate this to the term in the induction hypothesis `10^k - (-1 : ℤ)^k`.
    -- Consider the expression `10 * (10^k - (-1 : ℤ)^k)`.
    -- This expands to `10 * 10^k - 10 * (-1 : ℤ)^k`.
    -- Let's see how the target expression `10 * 10^k + (-1)^k` relates to `10 * 10^k - 10 * (-1 : ℤ)^k`.
    -- The difference is `(10 * 10^k + (-1)^k) - (10 * 10^k - 10 * (-1 : ℤ)^k)`
    --                 `= (-1)^k + 10 * (-1)^k`
    --                 `= (1 + 10) * (-1)^k`
    --                 `= 11 * (-1)^k`.
    -- So, `10^(k+1) - (-1 : ℤ)^(k+1) = 10 * (10^k - (-1 : ℤ)^k) + 11 * (-1 : ℤ)^k`.

    -- We prove this identity as a separate step using `have`.
    have h_identity : 10 ^ (k + 1) - (-1 : ℤ) ^ (k + 1) = 10 * (10 ^ k - (-1 : ℤ) ^ k) + 11 * (-1 : ℤ) ^ k := by
      -- Expand powers using `pow_succ`.
      simp [pow_succ]
      -- The equality now involves only addition, subtraction, and multiplication of integers and powers of -1.
      -- `ring` can prove this algebraic identity.
      ring

    -- Now the goal is to prove `11 ∣ (10 * (10 ^ k - (-1 : ℤ) ^ k) + 11 * (-1 : ℤ) ^ k)`.
    -- We know from the induction hypothesis `ih` that `11 ∣ (10^k - (-1 : ℤ)^k)`.
    -- Using `Dvd.dvd.mul_left`, we know that if `a ∣ b`, then `a ∣ c * b`.
    have h_term1 : 11 ∣ 10 * (10 ^ k - (-1 : ℤ) ^ k) := by
      -- Apply the `mul_left` method on the hypothesis `ih`.
      -- ih is `11 ∣ (10^k - (-1 : ℤ)^k)`. Applying `ih.mul_left 10` proves `11 ∣ 10 * (10^k - (-1)^k)`.
      -- -- The original buggy line was `apply dvd_mul_left 10 ih`, which was likely intended to use `dvd_mul_left_of_dvd` or similar, or was a misunderstanding.
      -- -- The error message suggested `apply dvd_mul_left 10 ih` is trying to use a different theorem or applying it incorrectly.
      -- -- The correct theorem in mathlib for `a ∣ b → a ∣ c*b` is `dvd_mul_left_of_dvd` or the method `Dvd.dvd.mul_left`. Using the method is more idiomatic Lean 4.
      -- apply dvd_mul_left_of_dvd -- This requires providing `ih` as an argument.
      -- exact ih
      apply ih.mul_left 10 -- -- Apply the `mul_left` method of the divisibility hypothesis `ih`. This proves `11 ∣ 10 * (10^k - (-1)^k)`.

    -- We also know that `11` divides `11 * (-1 : ℤ)^k` because it is a multiple of 11.
    -- The theorem `dvd_mul_right` states that `a ∣ a * c`.
    have h_term2 : 11 ∣ 11 * (-1 : ℤ) ^ k := by
      -- Apply the theorem `dvd_mul_right` with `a=11` and `b=(-1 : ℤ)^k`.
      -- -- The original buggy line was `apply dvd_mul_self_left`. The error was "unknown identifier 'dvd_mul_self_left'".
      -- -- We replace it with the correct theorem `dvd_mul_right a b` which proves `a ∣ a * b`.
      apply dvd_mul_right 11 ((-1 : ℤ) ^ k) -- -- Apply the theorem `dvd_mul_right a b` which proves `a ∣ a * b`.

    -- The sum of two integers divisible by 11 is also divisible by 11.
    -- We apply the `dvd_add` theorem.
    have h_sum_divisible : 11 ∣ 10 * (10 ^ k - (-1 : ℤ) ^ k) + 11 * (-1 : ℤ) ^ k := by
      apply dvd_add h_term1 h_term2 -- Apply the theorem `dvd_add a b c (hab : a ∣ b) (hac : a ∣ c) : a ∣ b + c` with a=11, b=10 * ..., c=11 * ...

    -- We have shown that the expression `10 * (10 ^ k - (-1 : ℤ) ^ k) + 11 * (-1 : ℤ) ^ k` is divisible by 11 (`h_sum_divisible`).
    -- We have also shown that `10^(k+1) - (-1 : ℤ)^(k+1)` is equal to this expression (`h_identity`).
    -- By the property that if `a = b` and `c ∣ a`, then `c ∣ b`, we can substitute the equality into the divisibility statement using `rw`.
    -- Using `rw [h_identity]` transforms the goal `11 ∣ (10^(k+1) - (-1 : ℤ)^(k+1))` into `11 ∣ (10 * (10 ^ k - (-1 : ℤ) ^ k) + 11 * (-1 : ℤ) ^ k)`.
    -- We already proved this (it is `h_sum_divisible`).
    rw [h_identity]
    exact h_sum_divisible -- The goal is now exactly `h_sum_divisible`.
