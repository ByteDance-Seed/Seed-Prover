theorem mathd_algebra_359
  (y : ℝ)
  (h₀ : y + 6 + y = 2 * 12) :
  y = 9 := by

  -- The hypothesis is y + 6 + y = 2 * 12. We want to show y = 9.
  -- First, simplify the hypothesis.
  -- y + 6 + y simplifies to 2 * y + 6
  -- 2 * 12 simplifies to 24
  -- simp made no progress, let's use ring to simplify the algebraic expression y + 6 + y
  -- -- The message indicates "unexpected token 'at'" for `ring at h₀`.
  -- -- The `ring` tactic does not support the `at` keyword in this way.
  -- -- We can achieve the simplification of the hypothesis by using `rw` with an equality proved by `ring`.
  rw [show y + 6 + y = 2 * y + 6 by ring] at h₀
  -- Now we have h₀ : 2 * y + 6 = 2 * 12. Simplify the right side using norm_num.
  -- Note: `norm_num at h₀` is a valid syntax for `norm_num`.
  norm_num at h₀
  -- Now we have h₀ : 2 * y + 6 = 24. Subtract 6 from both sides.
  -- The tactic 'rewrite' failed when using `eq_sub_of_add_eq` because it is an implication (a + c = b → a = b - c), not an equality or equivalence suitable for `rw`.
  -- We use `have` to derive the conclusion of the implication from the hypothesis `h₀`.
  have h₁ : (2 : ℝ) * y = (24 : ℝ) - (6 : ℝ) := eq_sub_of_add_eq h₀
  -- This gives h₁ : 2 * y = 24 - 6. Simplify the right side.
  norm_num at h₁
  -- Now we have h₁ : 2 * y = 18. Divide by 2.
  -- We need to show that 2 is not zero for the division.
  have two_ne_zero : (2 : ℝ) ≠ 0 := by norm_num
  -- -- The error was "unknown identifier 'eq_div_of_mul_eq_left'". The correct theorem name for this operation in GroupWithZero is `eq_div_of_mul_eq`.
  -- -- The previous rw step failed because `rw` expects an equality proof term, not an implication application result directly.
  -- -- We should first create the equality proof using `have` and then use `rw` with that proof.
  -- -- The error was "application type mismatch". The theorem `eq_div_of_mul_eq` expects the multiplication `a * c = b`, but `h₁` is `c * a = b`.
  -- -- Since multiplication is commutative for real numbers, we can rewrite h₁ using `mul_comm`.
  rw [mul_comm] at h₁
  -- Now h₁ is y * (2 : ℝ) = (18 : ℝ). We can apply eq_div_of_mul_eq with a=y, c=2, b=18.
  -- -- The previous application `eq_div_of_mul_eq two_ne_zero h₁` failed because `eq_div_of_mul_eq` expects the arguments in a different order or the hypothesis `h₁` in a specific form (`y * 2 = 18`).
  -- -- By rewriting `h₁` using `mul_comm` from `2 * y = 18` to `y * 2 = 18`, the theorem `eq_div_of_mul_eq` can now be applied correctly.
  have H_eq : y = (18 : ℝ) / (2 : ℝ) := eq_div_of_mul_eq two_ne_zero h₁
  rw [H_eq]
  -- The goal is now (18 : ℝ) / (2 : ℝ) = 9. Simplify the left side using norm_num.
  norm_num
  -- -- The tactic `norm_num` solved the goal `(18 : ℝ) / (2 : ℝ) = 9` by simplifying it to `9 = 9` and proving it.
  -- -- The following `rfl` was redundant as the goal was already solved.
  -- rfl
