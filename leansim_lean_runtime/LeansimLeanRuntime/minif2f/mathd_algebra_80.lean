  (h₁ : (x - 9) / (x + 1) = 2) :
  x = -11 := by

  -- The goal is to solve the equation (x - 9) / (x + 1) = 2 for x, given x ≠ -1.
  -- Since x ≠ -1, we know x + 1 ≠ 0, which allows us to multiply both sides by x + 1.

  -- Prove that x + 1 is not zero from the hypothesis x ≠ -1.
  have h₂ : x + 1 ≠ 0 := by
    -- Assume for contradiction that x + 1 = 0.
    intro H
    -- This implies x = -1.
    -- The previous `simp at H` did not make progress as it's a simple equality.
    -- We use `rw [eq_neg_iff_add_eq_zero]` to rewrite the equality H : x + 1 = 0 into x = -1.
    -- The theorem `eq_neg_iff_add_eq_zero` states `a = -b ↔ a + b = 0`.
    -- We have `H : x + 1 = 0`, and we want to get `x = -1`. This corresponds to rewriting `a + b = 0` to `a = -b`.
    -- Therefore, we need to use the equivalence in the reverse direction, indicated by `←`.
    rw [← eq_neg_iff_add_eq_zero] at H
    -- This contradicts the hypothesis h₀ : x ≠ -1.
    exact h₀ H

  -- Rewrite the equation h₁ using the fact that x + 1 ≠ 0.
  -- The theorem `div_eq_iff_mul_eq` states a / b = c ↔ a = c * b given b ≠ 0.
  rw [div_eq_iff_mul_eq h₂] at h₁
  -- After the rewrite, h₁ is now x - 9 = 2 * (x + 1).
  -- Note: The error message indicated that h₁ was 2 * (x + 1) = x - 9 at the step where the error occurred.
  -- Assuming the error message is accurate about the state at that line...

  -- We have the equation x - 9 = 2 * (x + 1).
  -- Rearrange the equation to the form `... = 0`.
  -- We want to show (x - 9) - (2 * (x + 1)) = 0.
  -- The theorem `sub_eq_zero_of_eq` states a = b → a - b = 0.
  -- Our hypothesis h₁ should be of the form a = b, where a = x - 9 and b = 2 * (x + 1).
  -- The error message stated that h₁ had the type `(2 : ℝ) * (x + (1 : ℝ)) = x - (9 : ℝ)` at this point.
  -- This is the reverse form `b = a`. To use `sub_eq_zero_of_eq`, we need `a = b`, so we reverse h₁ using `Eq.symm`.
  have h₃ : (x - 9) - (2 * (x + 1)) = 0 := by
    -- The previous attempt `exact sub_eq_zero_of_eq h₁` failed because h₁ had the incorrect type according to the error message.
    -- We use `Eq.symm h₁` to get the required form `x - 9 = 2 * (x + 1)`.
    exact sub_eq_zero_of_eq (Eq.symm h₁)

  -- Simplify the left side of h₃ using ring properties.
  -- (x - 9) - (2 * (x + 1)) = x - 9 - (2*x + 2) = x - 9 - 2*x - 2 = -x - 11.
  have h₄ : (x - 9) - (2 * (x + 1)) = -x - 11 := by
    ring

  -- Rewrite h₃ using the simplified left side h₄.
  rw [h₄] at h₃
  -- h₃ is now -x - 11 = 0.

  -- Solve -x - 11 = 0 for x.
  -- -x - 11 = 0 <=> -x = 11
  -- We want to prove x = -11.
  -- Use the theorem neg_eq_iff_eq_neg : (-a = b) ↔ (a = -b) to rewrite the goal.
  -- The current goal is x = -11, which matches the right side (a = -b) with a=x, b=11.
  -- Rewriting using the equivalence will change the goal to the left side (-a = b), which is -x = 11.
  -- The previous attempt used `rw [neg_eq_iff_eq_neg]` which tries to match the LHS `-a = b` in the goal, but the goal is `a = -b`.
  -- To rewrite `a = -b` to `-a = b`, we need to use the reverse direction of the equivalence, indicated by `←`.
  rw [← neg_eq_iff_eq_neg]
  -- The goal is now -x = 11.

  -- Now we have h₃ : -x - 11 = 0, and the goal is -x = 11.
  -- Use the theorem `eq_of_sub_eq_zero` which states a - b = 0 → a = b.
  -- Applying this to h₃ (-x - 11 = 0) proves -x = 11.
  exact (eq_of_sub_eq_zero h₃)
  -- This closes the goal.
