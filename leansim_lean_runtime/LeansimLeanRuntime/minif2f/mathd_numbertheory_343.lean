  -- The previous step `norm_cast` already transformed the goal into a form that Lean's kernel can evaluate.
  -- The product ∏ k in range 6, (2 * k + 1 : ℤ) evaluates to 10395 : ℤ.
  -- The goal becomes (10395 : ℤ) % (10 : ℤ) = (5 : ℤ), which simplifies to (5 : ℤ) = (5 : ℤ) by definition of Int.emod.
  -- This equality is definitionally true (`rfl`). The goal is already solved by `norm_cast`.
