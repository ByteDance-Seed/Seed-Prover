  -- We are given the formula for v: v = 1/3 * (b * h)
  -- We are given specific values for b and h: b = 30 and h = 13/2
  -- The goal is to show that v = 65
  -- Substitute the given values of b and h into the equation for v (h₁).
  rw [h₂, h₃] at h₁
  -- The hypothesis h₁ is now v = 1 / 3 * (30 * (13 / 2)).
  -- We need to evaluate the right-hand side of this equation: 1 / 3 * (30 * (13 / 2))
  -- Let's calculate this value.
  -- 30 * (13 / 2) = (30 / 2) * 13 = 15 * 13 = 195
  -- 1 / 3 * 195 = 195 / 3 = 65
  -- We can use a tactic to perform this numerical calculation.
  -- -- The error was in the use of field_simp which resulted in an unsolved goal. Let's use norm_num directly to compute the value.
  -- The previous h_calc was using natural numbers (ℕ), which resulted in a type mismatch with h₁ which involves real numbers (ℝ).
  -- We need to perform the calculation using real numbers (ℝ) to match the type in h₁.
  have h_calc : (1 : ℝ) / (3 : ℝ) * ((30 : ℝ) * ((13 : ℝ) / (2 : ℝ))) = (65 : ℝ) := by

  -- Now we have h₁ : v = (1 : ℝ) / (3 : ℝ) * ((30 : ℝ) * ((13 : ℝ) / (2 : ℝ))) and h_calc : (1 : ℝ) / (3 : ℝ) * ((30 : ℝ) * ((13 : ℝ) / (2 : ℝ))) = (65 : ℝ).
  -- We can use h_calc to rewrite h₁.
  rw [h_calc] at h₁
  -- This changes h₁ to v = 65.
  -- This is exactly the goal we want to prove.
