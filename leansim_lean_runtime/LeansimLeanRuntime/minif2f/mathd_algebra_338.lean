  -- We have the system of equations:

  -- 2) a + 3b + c = 9
  -- 3) a + b + 3c = 19

  -- Subtract (2) from (1)
  -- The previous line `a * b * c = -56 := by have h3 : ...` was syntactically incorrect.
  -- It attempted to start a `have` statement with the theorem goal as the identifier, within the main `by` block.
  -- We remove the incorrect prefix and keep only the intended `have h3 : ...`.

  -- -3 - 9 = -12
  -- So, 2a - 2b = -12
  -- The previous proof `by ring at h3; exact h3` was causing an "unsolved goals" error because the `exact h3` tactic
  -- was attempted on the goal `2 * a - 2 * b = -12` while `h3` was in the process of being simplified by `ring at h3`.
  -- A more direct way to prove `h4` from `h3` is to rewrite the goal using `h3` and then use `ring`.

    -- The previous attempt `rw [← h3]` failed because it tried to rewrite the LHS of the target
    -- with the LHS of `h3`, but `2*a - 2*b` is not definitionally equal to the LHS of `h3` before simplification.
    -- Instead, we should rewrite the RHS of the target (`-12`) to match the RHS of `h3` (`-3 - 9`),

    -- The target has `-10` as a real number (`-(10 : ℝ)`).
    -- The tactic `rw [h_rhs_eq]` failed because it looked for the integer literal `-(10 : ℤ)` in the real target `-(10 : ℝ)`, as seen in the error message.
