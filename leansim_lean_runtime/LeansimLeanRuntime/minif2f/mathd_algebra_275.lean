 -- The exponent (1 / 4) in the theorem statement is interpreted as natural number division, which evaluates to 0.
 -- Thus, the base ((11:ℝ)^(1 / 4)) is actually (11:ℝ)^0 = 1.

    -- Proof that (11:ℝ)^(1/4 : ℕ) = 1
    -- (1/4 : ℕ) is 0. (11:ℝ)^0 is 1 by definition of rpow for 0 exponent (if base is not 0).
    -- norm_num evaluates this expression.

  -- Rewrite the base in the hypothesis h using h_base_one.
  -- h is originally ((11:ℝ)^(1 / 4))^(3 * x - 3) = 1 / 5.

  -- Evaluate the left side of h: 1^(3 * x - 3).
  -- For any real exponent y, 1^y = 1 (assuming the base 1 is positive, which is true).

  -- We can use `norm_num` to evaluate this equality and show it is false.

    -- The goal is False. We have h : 1 = 1/5.
    -- Using norm_num at h directly proves False and solves the goal.
    norm_num at h
    -- The tactic 'exact h' is redundant because 'norm_num at h' simplifies 'h' to 'False' and the goal is also 'False', which automatically closes the goal.

  -- Now we have derived a contradiction `contradiction : False`.
  -- We can prove any goal from False using `False.elim`.

  -- Before using `False.elim`, let's simplify the goal for clarity, although it's not strictly necessary.
  -- Goal is ((11:ℝ)^(1 / 4))^(6 * x + 2) = 121 / 25.
