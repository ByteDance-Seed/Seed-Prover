  -- The goal is to prove the equality (x + 4)^2 + (y-3)^2 = 5^2.
  -- This problem relates to completing the square on the equation given by the hypothesis h₀.

  -- Expand the left side of the equality we want to prove: (x + 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2.
  -- Using the square of a sum (a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 and square of a difference (a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2,
  -- we have (x + 4)^2 = x^2 + 8x + 16 and (y - 3)^2 = y^2 - 6y + 9.
  -- So, (x + 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = (x^2 + 8x + 16) + (y^2 - 6y + 9).
  -- Rearranging and combining the constant terms, this is equal to x^2 + 8x + y^2 - 6y + 25.
  -- We can prove this algebraic identity directly using the `ring` tactic.
  have h_expand : (x + 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = x^2 + 8 * x + y^2 - 6 * y + 25 := by ring

  -- Now, rewrite the left side of the goal with this expanded form.
  -- The goal changes from (x + 4)^2 + (y-3)^2 = 5^2
  -- to x^2 + 8 * x + y^2 - 6 * y + 25 = 5^2.
  rw [h_expand]

  -- We are given the hypothesis h₀ : x^2 + 8 * x + y^2 - 6 * y = 0.
  -- We can use this equality to substitute the term x^2 + 8 * x + y^2 - 6 * y with 0 in the goal.
  -- The goal changes from x^2 + 8 * x + y^2 - 6 * y + 25 = 5^2
  -- to 0 + 25 = 5^2.
  rw [h₀]

  -- Now, simplify the left side of the equality.
  -- 0 + 25 simplifies to 25.
  -- We can use the `simp` tactic for this basic arithmetic simplification.
  simp -- This simplifies 0 + 25 to 25.
  -- The goal is now 25 = 5^2.

  -- Finally, simplify the right side of the equality.
  -- 5^2 simplifies to 25.
  -- We can use the `norm_num` tactic to evaluate this numerical expression.
  norm_num -- The `norm_num` tactic evaluates numerical expressions like 5^2.
  -- The goal is now 25 = 25.

  -- The goal is an equality between identical terms (25 = 25).
  -- This is definitionally true and can be proven using the `rfl` tactic.
  -- The `norm_num` tactic has already simplified 5^2 to 25, making the goal 25 = 25.
  -- The `norm_num` tactic is capable of closing goals like this automatically.
  -- Therefore, the `rfl` tactic is redundant and causes the "no goals to be solved" error.
  -- We remove the redundant `rfl` tactic.
