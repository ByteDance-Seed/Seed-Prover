  (129^34 + 96^38) % 11 = 9 := by 
  -- The goal is to compute the remainder of a sum of powers when divided by 11.
  -- We use the properties of modular arithmetic.
  -- (a + b) % n = ((a % n) + (b % n)) % n
  -- a^k % n = (a % n)^k % n for non-negative integers a, k, n

  -- Apply modular addition property.
  rw [Nat.add_mod]

  -- Apply modular exponentiation property to the first term (129^34 % 11).
  rw [Nat.pow_mod]

  -- First, reduce the base of the first term modulo 11.
  have h_129_mod_11 : 129 % 11 = 8 := by norm_num
  -- Substitute this result into the first term.
  rw [h_129_mod_11]

  -- Apply modular exponentiation property to the second term (96^38 % 11).
  -- -- The previous `rw [Nat.pow_mod]` tactics failed to apply to the second term because the first term still matched the pattern `_ ^ _ % _`.
  -- -- By applying `Nat.pow_mod` here, after the first term has been simplified by substituting the base, it will now apply correctly to the second term.
  rw [Nat.pow_mod]

  -- Reduce the base of the second term modulo 11.
  have h_96_mod_11 : 96 % 11 = 8 := by norm_num
  -- Substitute this result into the second term.
  -- -- The previous attempt `rw [h_96_mod_11]` failed because `96 % 11` was not present in the target, as `Nat.pow_mod` hadn't been applied to the second term yet.
  -- -- Now that `Nat.pow_mod` has been applied to the second term (`96^38 % 11` became `(96 % 11)^38 % 11`), this rewrite will succeed in substituting `(96 % 11)` with `8`.
  rw [h_96_mod_11]

  -- The goal is now to show that (8^34 % 11 + 8^38 % 11) % 11 = 9.
  -- Since the expression involves only literal numbers and standard arithmetic operations
  -- (^ and %), the `norm_num` tactic can evaluate it.
