  (h₁ : t = 3 * s + 1) :
  s = 1 ∧ t = 4 := by

  -- We are given a system of two linear equations in two variables s and t.
  -- h₀ : s = 9 - 2 * t
  -- h₁ : t = 3 * s + 1
  -- We need to solve this system and prove that the unique solution is s = 1 and t = 4.

  -- We can use the substitution method. Substitute the expression for t from h₁ into h₀.
  -- This will give us a single equation involving only s.
  -- We want to derive s = 9 - 2 * (3 * s + 1).
  -- Start with h₀: s = 9 - 2 * t.
  -- Substitute t using h₁: t = 3 * s + 1.
  -- We will rewrite the right side of h₀ using h₁.
  have step1 : 9 - 2 * t = 9 - 2 * (3 * s + 1) := by
    -- Apply the rewrite rule h₁ to the term t on the left side of this equality.
    -- This replaces t with 3 * s + 1.
    rw [h₁]

  -- Now we have s = 9 - 2 * t (h₀) and 9 - 2 * t = 9 - 2 * (3 * s + 1) (step1).
  -- By transitivity of equality, s = 9 - 2 * (3 * s + 1).
  -- This is the equation we obtain by substituting t from h₁ into h₀.
  have h_s_eq : s = 9 - 2 * (3 * s + 1) := Eq.trans h₀ step1
  -- The original attempt inside the `by` block for `h_s_eq` was trying to prove the *target* `s = 9 - 2 * (3 * s + 1)` by rewriting the goal itself using `rw [h₁]`.
  -- This failed because the goal `s = 9 - 2 * (3 * s + 1)` does not contain the term `t` that `h₁` rewrites.
  -- We need to rewrite one of the existing hypotheses (`h₀`) instead of the target of the `have` statement.

  -- We now have the equation h_s_eq : s = 9 - 2 * (3 * s + 1).
  -- This is a linear equation in s. Let's simplify and rearrange it to solve for s.
  -- The equation is equivalent to:
  -- s = 9 - (6s + 2)
  -- s = 9 - 6s - 2
  -- s = 7 - 6s
  -- s + 6s = 7
  -- 7s = 7
  -- We can use the `linarith` tactic to derive `7 * s = 7` directly from `h_s_eq`, as `linarith` can solve linear equations.
  -- The previous attempt `ring [h_s_eq]` had a syntax error. `ring` typically works on the goal, while `linarith` can effectively use linear hypotheses to deduce goals.
  have h_7s_eq_7 : 7 * s = 7 := by
    -- Goal: `7 * s = 7`. Hypothesis: `h_s_eq : s = 9 - 2 * (3 * s + 1)`.
    -- `linarith` can deduce `7 * s = 7` from `h_s_eq`.
    linarith [h_s_eq] -- Use the specific hypothesis `h_s_eq`.

  -- We have successfully derived the equation 7 * s = 7. Now we solve for s.
  -- Since we are working with real numbers (ℝ), and 7 is non-zero, we can uniquely solve for s.
  -- The `linarith` tactic is well-suited for solving linear equations and inequalities over ℝ.
  have hs : s = 1 := by
    -- Goal: `s = 1`. Hypothesis: `h_7s_eq_7 : 7 * s = 7`.
    -- `linarith` can deduce `s = 1` from `7 * s = 7`.
    linarith [h_7s_eq_7] -- Use the specific hypothesis `h_7s_eq_7`.

  -- Now that we know the value of s (which is 1), we can substitute this value back into the second original equation h₁ : t = 3 * s + 1 to find the value of t.
  -- We already have `h₁ : t = 3 * s + 1`. Let's make a new hypothesis using this.
  have h_t_eq : t = 3 * s + 1 := h₁

  -- Substitute the value s = 1 (from hs) into the equation for t (`h_t_eq`).
  rw [hs] at h_t_eq

  -- The equation for t is now h_t_eq : t = 3 * 1 + 1.
  -- Simplify this equation to find the value of t.
  have ht : t = 4 := by
    -- Goal: `t = 4`. Hypothesis: `h_t_eq : t = 3 * 1 + 1`.
    -- Substitute the expression from `h_t_eq` into the goal.
    rw [h_t_eq]
    -- The goal is now `3 * 1 + 1 = 4`.
    -- `ring` simplifies the numerical expression `3 * 1 + 1` to `4`.
    ring -- Simplify the numerical expression using ring properties.

  -- We have successfully proved that s = 1 (stored in `hs`) and t = 4 (stored in `ht`).
  -- The goal is the conjunction s = 1 ∧ t = 4.
  -- We can use the `And.intro` constructor to prove a conjunction from proofs of its components.
  exact And.intro hs ht -- Combine the proofs `hs` and `ht` to prove the conjunction.
