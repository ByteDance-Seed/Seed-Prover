theorem amc12b_2020_p2 :
  ((100 ^ 2 - 7 ^ 2):‚Ñù) / (70 ^ 2 - 11 ^ 2) * ((70 - 11) * (70 + 11) / ((100 - 7) * (100 + 7))) = 1 := by

  -- The initial expression involves natural numbers implicitly coerced to real numbers.
  -- The 'decide' tactic failed because the expression was too complex for it to directly evaluate.
  -- We replace 'decide' with a detailed algebraic proof.

  -- We use `norm_cast` to simplify the expression by pushing the casts inwards and applying
  -- simplifications like the difference of squares for natural numbers under the cast using
  -- lemmas like `Nat.cast_sq_sub_sq`.
  -- After `norm_cast`, the goal becomes an arithmetic expression involving only
  -- casted natural numbers, which can be evaluated by `norm_num`.
  norm_cast
  -- -- The `norm_cast` tactic successfully closed the goal by simplifying the expression to 1 = 1.
  -- -- The message "no goals to be solved" for the subsequent norm_num tactic indicated that norm_cast
  -- -- had already solved the goal, making norm_num redundant.
  -- The message "no goals to be solved" for the norm_num tactic indicates that the previous tactic (`norm_cast`) successfully closed the goal.
  -- As per the hint, a tactic resulting in "no goals to be solved" might be redundant. Since norm_cast solved the goal, norm_num is indeed redundant and can be removed.
  -- norm_num -- This line is removed as per the message and hint indicating redundancy.
  -- The goal is now 1 = 1, which is true by definition (refl).
  -- The previous detailed algebraic steps and non-zero proofs are not needed
  -- because `norm_cast` performs the arithmetic evaluation directly.
  -- rfl is not strictly needed after norm_cast if norm_cast closes the goal.
  -- rfl -- This line is commented out because norm_cast already solved the goal.
