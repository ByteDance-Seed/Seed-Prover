  -- The goal is to prove ((n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8)) % 9 = 0
  -- Simplify the expression inside the modulo: (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) = 3n + 18

  -- Simplify 3 * (3 * m) to 9 * m
  -- simp made no progress here
  -- Use mul_assoc and norm_num to simplify 3 * (3 * m) to 9 * m
  -- The theorem mul_assoc gives (a * b) * c = a * (b * c).
  -- The target has 3 * (3 * m). To rewrite this to (3 * 3) * m, we need the reverse direction of mul_assoc.
  rw [← mul_assoc 3 3 m]

  rw [show 3 * 3 = 9 by norm_num]

  rw [Nat.add_mod]
  -- The goal becomes ((9 * m) % 9 + 18 % 9) % 9 = 0
  -- We know (9 * m) % 9 = 0 because 9 divides 9 * m.
  -- The previous attempt to use Nat.mul_mod_left directly failed.
  -- We can use the fact that if n divides k, then k % n = 0 (Nat.mod_eq_zero_of_dvd).
  -- 9 divides 9 * m by Nat.dvd_mul_right.
  -- The previous attempt to use `rw [Nat.mul_comm 9 m]` introduced a term `(m * 9)` which did not syntactically match the proof `(Nat.dvd_mul_right 9 m)` which proves `9 ∣ 9 * m`.
  -- We remove the unnecessary `Nat.mul_comm` and use the correct divisibility proof for `(9 * m) % 9`.
  rw [Nat.mod_eq_zero_of_dvd (Nat.dvd_mul_right 9 m)]
  -- The goal becomes (0 + 18 % 9) % 9 = 0
  -- Simplify the expression.
  -- (0 + 18 % 9) % 9 simplifies to (0 + 0) % 9 which is 0 % 9 = 0.
  -- This simplification can be done directly with `norm_num` or `simp`.
  -- The message "no goals to be solved" for the simp tactic indicates that the goal (0 + 18 % 9) % 9 = 0 was already proved by evaluating the expression.
  -- We remove the redundant simp tactic.
