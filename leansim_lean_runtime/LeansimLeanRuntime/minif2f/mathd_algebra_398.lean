  (h₁ : 9 * b = 20 * c)
  (h₂ : 7 * a = 4 * b) :
  63 * a = 80 * c := by 
  -- The goal is to prove 63 * a = 80 * c using the given equations.
  -- We can rewrite the left side (63 * a) using h₂ and the right side (80 * c) using h₁.

  -- Rewrite 63 as 9 * 7 on the left side.
  -- The previous definition of h_63 was for natural numbers, but the target uses real numbers.
  -- We need an equality between real numbers to use in the rewrite.
  have h_63 : (63 : ℝ) = (9 : ℝ) * (7 : ℝ) := by norm_num
  rw [h_63, mul_assoc]
  -- The goal is now (9 * 7) * a = 80 * c, which simplifies to 9 * (7 * a) = 80 * c

  -- Use h₂ : 7 * a = 4 * b to rewrite 7 * a on the left side.
  rw [h₂]
  -- The goal is now 9 * (4 * b) = 80 * c

  -- Rewrite 80 as 4 * 20 on the right side.
  -- Similar to h_63, we need an equality of real numbers for h_80.
  have h_80 : (80 : ℝ) = (4 : ℝ) * (20 : ℝ) := by norm_num
  rw [h_80, mul_assoc]
  -- The goal is now 9 * (4 * b) = 4 * (20 * c)

  -- Use h₁ : 9 * b = 20 * c to rewrite 20 * c on the right side.
  -- We need to rewrite the right side of the goal (20 * c) using the equality h₁ (9 * b = 20 * c).
  -- The `rw` tactic by default rewrites the LHS of the equality with the RHS.
  -- To rewrite the RHS of the equality (20 * c) with the LHS (9 * b), we need to use `← h₁`.
  rw [← h₁]
  -- The goal is now 9 * (4 * b) = 4 * (9 * b)

  -- The current goal is an identity involving multiplication that holds in any commutative ring.
  -- We can use the `ring` tactic to prove this.
