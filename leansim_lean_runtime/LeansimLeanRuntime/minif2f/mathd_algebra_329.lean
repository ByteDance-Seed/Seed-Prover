  (x y : ℝ)

  (h₁ : 2 * x + 5 * y = 11) :
  x + y = 4 := by 

  -- We have the equations:
  -- h₀ : 3 * y = x
  -- h₁ : 2 * x + 5 * y = 11

  -- Substitute the expression for x from h₀ into h₁.
  -- The hypothesis h₀ states 3 * y = x. To substitute x with 3 * y in h₁,
  -- we need to use the equivalence x = 3 * y, which is the reverse direction of h₀.
  -- The reverse direction is indicated by `← h₀`.
  rw [← h₀] at h₁
  -- The hypothesis h₁ is now: 2 * (3 * y) + 5 * y = 11

  -- Simplify the left side of the equation h₁.
  -- We know that 2 * (3 * y) + 5 * y = 6 * y + 5 * y = 11 * y.
  -- We use the `ring` tactic to prove this algebraic identity.
  -- The previous attempt used `simp at h₁` which failed to make progress because `ring` is more suitable for this kind of algebraic simplification.
  have h_algebraic_identity : 2 * (3 * y) + 5 * y = 11 * y := by
    ring -- Prove the algebraic identity using ring

  -- Rewrite the hypothesis h₁ using the algebraic identity we just proved.
  rw [h_algebraic_identity] at h₁
  -- h₁ is now: 11 * y = 11

  -- We have h₁ : 11 * y = 11. To solve for y, we need to show that 11 is non-zero.
  have h_nonzero : (11 : ℝ) ≠ 0 := by
    -- Use norm_num to prove that 11 is not 0
    norm_num

  -- We want to use mul_left_cancel₀ to cancel 11 from both sides of 11 * y = 11.
  -- mul_left_cancel₀ a_nonzero (a * b = a * c) requires the equation to be in the form a * b = a * c.
  -- Our current h₁ is 11 * y = 11. We need to rewrite the right side (11) into the form 11 * 1.
  -- We use the `conv` tactic to target only the right-hand side of h₁.
  -- The previous attempt used `rw [← mul_one (11 : ℝ)] at h₁` which incorrectly applied the rewrite to both sides.
  conv at h₁ =>
    rhs -- Focus on the right-hand side of the equality
    -- We want to rewrite 11 as 11 * 1 using the theorem mul_one (11 : ℝ) = 11 * 1.
    -- The theorem mul_one (11 : ℝ) states 11 * 1 = 11.
    -- To rewrite 11 to 11 * 1, we need to use the reverse direction of this theorem.
    rw [← mul_one (11 : ℝ)]
  -- The hypothesis h₁ is now: 11 * y = 11 * 1

  -- Now we need to cancel `11` from both sides of `h₁` using `mul_left_cancel₀`.
  -- The theorem `mul_left_cancel₀ a_nonzero : a * b = a * c → b = c` requires the left-hand side multiplier `a` to be non-zero.
  -- In our case, `a` is `11`. We have the non-zero proof `h_nonzero : 11 ≠ 0`.
  -- We apply `mul_left_cancel₀` with `a = 11`, `b = y`, `c = 1`.
  -- The equation `h₁` is now `11 * y = 11 * 1`, which is in the correct format `a * b = a * c`.
  -- The previous attempt had h₁ in the form `(11 * 1) * y = (11 * 1)`, leading to a type mismatch when `mul_left_cancel₀` expected `(11 * 1) * y = (11 * 1) * 1`.
  have hy : y = 1 := mul_left_cancel₀ h_nonzero h₁
  -- hy is now: y = 1

  -- We have found y = 1. Now substitute this value back into h₀ to find x.
  rw [hy] at h₀
  -- The equation h₀ is now: 3 * 1 = x

  -- Simplify the left side of h₀
  norm_num at h₀
  -- The equation h₀ is now: 3 = x

  -- We have x = 3 and y = 1. Now prove the goal x + y = 4.
  -- Substitute the value of x into the goal
  rw [← h₀] -- h₀ is 3 = x, so we use ← h₀ to replace x with 3
  -- The goal is now: 3 + y = 4

  -- Substitute the value of y into the goal
  rw [hy]
  -- The goal is now: 3 + 1 = 4

  -- Simplify the arithmetic expression
  norm_num
  -- The goal is now: 4 = 4, which is true by reflexivity (handled by norm_num)
