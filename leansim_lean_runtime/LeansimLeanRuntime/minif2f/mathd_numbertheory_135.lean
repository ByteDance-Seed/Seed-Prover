  -- The problem asks for the value of 100*A + 10*B + C.
  -- We are given several constraints on n, A, B, and C.
  -- The most direct way to find the unique values of A, B, and C is
  -- by calculating n based on hypothesis h₀ and then determining its
  -- base-10 digits as given by hypothesis h₆.

  -- From h₀ and h₆, we know that the base-10 digits of the number (3^17 + 3^10)
  -- are represented by the list [B,A,B,C,C,A,C,B,A].

  -- Calculate the numerical value of (3^17 + 3^10) and its base-10 digits.
  -- We can use the `norm_num` tactic for this computation.
  -- First, calculate the sum: 3^17 + 3^10 = 129140163 + 59049 = 129199212.
  -- Then, calculate the base-10 digits of 129199212.
  -- The digits are listed from least significant to most significant:
  -- Nat.digits 10 129199212 = [2, 1, 2, 9, 9, 1, 9, 2, 1].
  have h_digits_val : Nat.digits 10 (3^17 + 3^10) = [2, 1, 2, 9, 9, 1, 9, 2, 1] := by

  -- We now have the equality between two lists of digits:
  -- [2, 1, 2, 9, 9, 1, 9, 2, 1] = [B,A,B,C,C,A,C,B,A].
  -- Since these lists are equal, their elements at corresponding positions must be equal.
  -- We can extract the specific equalities for A, B, and C.
  -- The previous attempt to use `rcases` resulted in an "unknown identifier" error.
  -- We will instead use `List.get?` and injection to equate elements.
  -- The digits list [B,A,B,C,C,A,C,B,A] represents the number in base 10,
  -- meaning the last element is the most significant digit.
  -- However, `Nat.digits` lists the digits from least significant to most significant.

  -- Now that we have determined the values of A, B, and C, we can substitute these values

  -- The goal is now the numerical equality 100 * 1 + 10 * 2 + 9 = 129.
  -- We can evaluate this using the `norm_num` tactic.
  -- The message "no goals to be solved" on the norm_num line indicates it was redundant.
  -- Lean likely simplifies the numerical expression 100*1 + 10*2 + 9 to 129 after the rewrite,
  -- making the goal 129 = 129, which is solved by reflexivity.
  -- We remove the redundant tactic.
  -- norm_num -- Deleted based on the message

  -- The other hypotheses (h₁, h₂, h₃, h₄, h₅) provide additional constraints on A, B, C,
  -- which are consistent with the values A=1, B=2, C=9 derived from h₀ and h₆.
  -- A=1, B=2, C=9
  -- h₁ : 11 ∣ (n + 1) -> 11 ∣ (129199212 + 1) -> 11 ∣ 129199213. 129199213 / 11 = 11745383. This holds.
  -- h₂ : [1,2,9].Pairwise (·≠·) -> 1≠2, 1≠9, 2≠9. This holds.
  -- h₃ : {1,2,9} ⊂ Finset.Icc 0 9 -> {1,2,9} is a subset of {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}. This holds.
  -- h₄ : Odd 1 ∧ Odd 9 -> true ∧ true. This holds.
  -- h₅ : ¬ 3 ∣ 2 -> ¬ false. This holds.
  -- These hypotheses are not strictly necessary for this proof which relies solely on the digits equality.
