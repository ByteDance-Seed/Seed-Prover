  (x y : ℝ)
  (h₀ : x + y = 25)
  (h₁ : x - y = 11) :
  x = 18 := by
 
  -- We are given two equations: h₀ : x + y = 25 and h₁ : x - y = 11.
  -- Adding the two equations together will eliminate the variable y.
  -- We use the `add_eq` theorem to add the left sides and the right sides of h₀ and h₁.
  -- The error message indicates `add_eq` is not the correct way to add equalities.
  -- A simpler way is to use rewriting. Start with one side of the desired equality,
  -- and rewrite using the given hypotheses.
  -- We want to show (x + y) + (x - y) = 25 + 11.
  -- We can rewrite the left side using h₀ and h₁.
  -- -- The previous attempt used `add_eq` which caused a "function expected" error.
  -- -- We correct this by using `rw` to substitute the terms in the equality.
  have h₂ : (x + y) + (x - y) = 25 + 11 := by rw [h₀, h₁]
  -- Now we simplify the equation h₂.
  -- The left side (x + y) + (x - y) simplifies to 2 * x.
  have h_lhs_simp : (x + y) + (x - y) = 2 * x := by
    -- The `ring` tactic can simplify this algebraic expression.
    ring
  -- The right side 25 + 11 simplifies to 36.
  -- We need to specify the type as ℝ to match the context of h₂.
  have h_rhs_simp : (25 : ℝ) + (11 : ℝ) = (36 : ℝ) := by
    -- The `norm_num` tactic can evaluate this numerical expression.
    norm_num
  -- We now rewrite the equation h₂ using these simplified forms.
  rw [h_lhs_simp, h_rhs_simp] at h₂
  -- The equation is now h₂ : 2 * x = 36.
  -- To find x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2.
  -- First, we must show that the number 2 is not zero in the real numbers.
  have h_two_ne_zero : (2 : ℝ) ≠ 0 := by
    -- `norm_num` can prove that 2 is not equal to 0.
    norm_num
  -- We also rewrite the right side of the equation, 36, as 2 * 18.
  have h_36_eq : (36 : ℝ) = (2 : ℝ) * (18 : ℝ) := by
    -- `norm_num` can prove this numerical equality.
    norm_num
  -- Substitute 36 with 2 * 18 in the equation h₂.
  rw [h_36_eq] at h₂
  -- The equation is now h₂ : 2 * x = 2 * 18.
  -- Since we have shown that 2 is non-zero (h_two_ne_zero), we can use the `mul_left_cancel₀` theorem.
  -- `mul_left_cancel₀ a h_ne_zero h_eq` proves that if a ≠ 0 and `a * b = a * c`, then `b = c`.
  -- The previous attempt used `mul_left_cancel`, which has a different type signature and expects the equality as the first argument.
  -- We need `mul_left_cancel₀` which takes the non-zero proof first.
