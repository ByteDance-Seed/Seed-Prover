  -- The goal is to prove σ.1 (σ.1 10) = 1.
  -- σ is an equivalence, so σ.1 is the forward map and σ.2 is the inverse map.
  -- The fundamental property of equivalences is that applying the map and its inverse in sequence results in the identity.
  -- Specifically, for any x, σ.1 (σ.2 x) = x and σ.2 (σ.1 x) = x.

  -- Let's evaluate the inner term σ.1 10.
  -- We know that for any x, σ.1 (σ.2 x) = x. Let's use this with x = 2.
  -- We have σ.1 (σ.2 2) = 2 by Equiv.apply_symm_apply σ 2.
  -- We are given h₀ : σ.2 2 = 10.

    -- We use the identity property for equivalences: σ (σ.symm x) = x for x in the target type.
