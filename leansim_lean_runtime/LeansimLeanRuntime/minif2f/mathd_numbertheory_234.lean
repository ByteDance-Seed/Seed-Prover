  (h₁ : (10 * a + b)^3 = 912673) :
  a + b = 16 := by

  -- We are given that (10 * a + b)^3 = 912673.
  -- First, evaluate the right side as a power.
  -- We calculate 97^3 = 912673.
  -- Rewrite the given equation using this fact.
  have h₂ : (10 * a + b)^3 = 97^3 := by rw [h₁]; norm_num

  -- Since the base is natural numbers, we can take the cube root on both sides as long as the exponent is non-zero.
  -- We use the lemma `Nat.pow_eq_pow_iff_left`.
  -- The lemma requires the exponent to be non-zero (3 ≠ 0).
  -- have h₃ : 10 * a + b = 97 := by
    -- The previous error "unknown constant 'Nat.pow_eq_pow_iff_right'" indicates that the theorem name was incorrect.
    -- The correct theorem for `a^n = b^n ↔ a = b` in natural numbers when `n ≠ 0` is `Nat.pow_eq_pow_iff_left`.
    -- apply (Nat.pow_eq_pow_iff_left (by norm_num)).mp h₂
    -- Provide the proof that the exponent 3 is not zero.
    -- norm_num -- This line was redundant as it was inside the proof for the condition.

  -- The theorem `Nat.pow_eq_pow_iff_left` seems to be causing issues with constant lookup.
  -- We will prove the equality by proving two inequalities using `Nat.pow_le_pow_iff_left`.
  -- First, prove `10 * a + b ≤ 97` from `(10 * a + b)^3 = 97^3`.
  -- The equality implies the inequality `(10 * a + b)^3 ≤ 97^3`.
  -- `Nat.pow_le_pow_iff_left (n ≠ 0)` states that `a^n ≤ b^n ↔ a ≤ b`. We use the reverse implication.
  -- Need a proof that the exponent 3 is non-zero.
  -- -- Introduce a proof for the non-zero exponent condition needed for Nat.pow_le_pow_iff_left.
  have h_nz_3 : 3 ≠ 0 := by norm_num

  -- -- Apply the lemma Nat.pow_le_pow_iff_left using the non-zero proof h_nz_3.
  -- -- We use the mpr direction (←) to prove `a ≤ b` from `a^3 ≤ b^3`.
  -- -- The inequality `(10 * a + b)^3 ≤ 97^3` comes from the equality h₂ using Nat.le_of_eq.
  -- This comment incorrectly says mpr. We need to prove a ≤ b from a^3 ≤ b^3, which is the mp direction.
  have h_le : 10 * a + b ≤ 97 := by apply (Nat.pow_le_pow_iff_left h_nz_3).mp (Nat.le_of_eq h₂)
  -- Second, prove `97 ≤ 10 * a + b` from `(10 * a + b)^3 = 97^3`.
  -- The equality implies the inequality `97^3 ≤ (10 * a + b)^3`.
  -- We again use the forward implication of `Nat.pow_le_pow_iff_left (n ≠ 0)`.
  -- We apply the theorem `a'^n ≤ b'^n ↔ a' ≤ b'` with `a' = 97` and `b' = 10*a+b`.
  -- We need to prove `97 ≤ 10*a+b` from `97^3 ≤ (10*a+b)^3`.
  -- This requires applying mp to `97^3 ≤ (10*a+b)^3`.
  -- The inequality `97^3 ≤ (10 * a + b)^3` comes from the equality h₂ using Nat.le_of_eq after symmetric equality.
  -- -- Apply the lemma Nat.pow_le_pow_iff_left using the non-zero proof h_nz_3.
  -- -- We use the mpr direction (←) to prove `a' ≤ b'` from `a'^3 ≤ b'^3`.
  -- -- The inequality `97^3 ≤ (10 * a + b)^3` comes from the equality h₂ using Nat.le_of_eq (Eq.symm h₂).
  -- The comment incorrectly says mpr. We need to prove a' ≤ b' from a'^3 ≤ b'^3, which is the mp direction.
  -- The previous version incorrectly used mpr; changing it to mp.
  have h_ge : 97 ≤ 10 * a + b := by apply (Nat.pow_le_pow_iff_left h_nz_3).mp (Nat.le_of_eq (Eq.symm h₂))
  -- Combine the two inequalities to get the equality `10 * a + b = 97`.
  have h₃ : 10 * a + b = 97 := by apply le_antisymm h_le h_ge

  -- Now we have the equation `10 * a + b = 97` and the constraints `1 ≤ a ≤ 9` and `b ≤ 9` from `h₀`.
  -- Extract the constraints from h₀ using rcases.
  rcases h₀ with ⟨ha_ge_1, ha_le_9, hb_le_9⟩

  -- From `10 * a + b = 97` and `b ≤ 9`, we can derive a lower bound for `a`.
  -- `10 * a = 97 - b`. Since `b ≤ 9`, we have `-b ≥ -9`.
  -- Thus, `10 * a = 97 - b ≥ 97 - 9 = 88`.
  -- So, `10 * a ≥ 88`.
  have h_10a_ge_88 : 10 * a ≥ 88 := by
    -- We want to prove 10 * a ≥ 88 from 10 * a + b = 97 and b ≤ 9.
    -- This is a linear inequality in natural numbers, solvable by linarith.
    linarith [h₃, hb_le_9]

  -- From `10 * a ≥ 88` and the fact that `a` is a natural number, we can deduce that `a` must be at least 9.
  -- If `a` were less than 9 (`a ≤ 8`), then `10 * a ≤ 80`, which contradicts `10 * a ≥ 88`.
  -- We use the `omega` tactic which is good for natural number linear inequalities.
  have ha_ge_9 : 9 ≤ a := by
    -- The previous syntax `omega [h_10a_ge_88]` was incorrect.
    -- Omega can use hypotheses in the context automatically.
    -- Removing the brackets should fix the parsing error.
    omega -- Use omega with the hypothesis h_10a_ge_88 available in the context

  -- We have `a ≤ 9` (from `ha_le_9`) and `a ≥ 9` (from `ha_ge_9`).
  -- This implies that `a` must be equal to 9 by antisymmetry of ≤ for natural numbers.
  have ha : a = 9 := by
    apply le_antisymm ha_le_9 ha_ge_9

  -- Now substitute `a = 9` into the equation `10 * a + b = 97`.
  -- The equation becomes `10 * 9 + b = 97`.
  have h_90_plus_b_eq_97 : 90 + b = 97 := by
    rw [ha] at h₃ -- Replace 'a' with '9' in h₃.
    simp at h₃ -- Simplify '10 * 9' to '90'.
    exact h₃ -- The hypothesis h₃ now matches the goal.

  -- From `90 + b = 97`, we can solve for `b`.
  -- Subtracting 90 from both sides gives `b = 7`.
  -- We use `linarith` or `omega` for simple linear equations in natural numbers.
  have hb : b = 7 := by
    linarith [h_90_plus_b_eq_97]

  -- We have found `a = 9` and `b = 7`.
  -- These values satisfy the original constraints `1 ≤ 9 ≤ 9` and `7 ≤ 9`.

  -- The goal is to prove `a + b = 16`.
  -- Substitute the found values of `a` (9) and `b` (7) into the goal.
  rw [ha, hb]
  -- The goal becomes `9 + 7 = 16`.
  -- Use `norm_num` to evaluate the numerical expression.
  -- The 'no goals to be solved' message indicates that the goal was already closed after the rewrite.
  -- This likely happens because `9 + 7 = 16` is solvable by `rfl` after simple arithmetic reduction, which might be triggered automatically after `rw`.
  -- Therefore, the `norm_num` tactic here is redundant and can be removed.
  -- norm_num -- Removed redundant tactic
