  (b :  ZMod (11^2))
  (h₀ : b = 24⁻¹) :
  b = 116 := by 
  -- The modulus is n = 11^2 = 121. We are working in ZMod 121.
  -- The hypothesis states that b is the multiplicative inverse of 24 in ZMod 121.
  -- The goal is to prove that b is equal to 116 in ZMod 121.
  -- From the hypothesis h₀, we have b = 24⁻¹. So the goal is equivalent to proving 24⁻¹ = 116.

  -- Replace b with 24⁻¹ using the hypothesis h₀.
  rw [h₀]
  -- The goal is now 24⁻¹ = 116.

  -- To show that 116 is the inverse of 24, we can use the property that if a * c = 1, then c is the inverse of a (assuming the inverse exists, which it does for 24 in ZMod 121 as gcd(24, 121) = 1).
  -- The theorem `ZMod.inv_eq_of_mul_eq_one` states exactly this: `a * c = 1` implies `c = a⁻¹`.
  -- We want to show `116 = 24⁻¹`. By the theorem, this requires showing `24 * 116 = 1`.
  apply ZMod.inv_eq_of_mul_eq_one
  -- The goal is now (24 : ZMod (11^2)) * (116 : ZMod (11^2)) = 1.

  -- Now we compute the product on the left side within ZMod (11^2).
  -- (24 : ZMod 121) * (116 : ZMod 121) = (24 * 116 : ZMod 121).
  -- Calculate the integer product 24 * 116.
  -- 24 * 116 = 2784.
  -- So the left side is (2784 : ZMod 121).
  -- We need to show (2784 : ZMod 121) = 1.
  -- This equality holds if and only if 2784 is congruent to 1 modulo 121, i.e., 2784 % 121 = 1.
  -- Let's perform the division: 2784 = 23 * 121 + 1.
  -- The remainder is 1, so 2784 ≡ 1 (mod 121).
  -- Thus, (2784 : ZMod 121) is indeed equal to (1 : ZMod 121).

  -- Use `norm_num` to evaluate the numerical expression (24 * 116 : ZMod (11^2)).
  norm_num
  -- The goal is now (2784 : ZMod 121) = 1.

  -- This equality is true by definition of the ZMod representation (it means 2784 % 121 = 1).
  -- `rfl` can prove this definitional equality.
  rfl
  -- The proof is complete.
