  (n : ℕ)
  (h₀ : n = 11) :
  (1 / 4)^(n + 1) * 2^(2 * n) = 1 / 4 := by 
 
  -- The goal is (1/4)^(n + 1) * 2^(2 * n) = 1 / 4.
  -- The base numbers (1/4 and 2) are real numbers, and the exponents (n+1 and 2*n) are natural numbers.
  -- By default, a real number raised to a natural number is interpreted using `pow x (n : ℕ)`.
  -- Substitute the given condition n = 11 into the goal.
  rw [h₀]
  -- The goal becomes (1 / 4)^(11 + 1) * 2^(2 * 11) = 1 / 4.
  -- Simplify the exponents which are natural numbers.
  simp
  -- The goal is now (1 / 4)^12 * 2^22 = 1 / 4.
  -- The previous `simp` tactic was powerful enough to evaluate the powers and the multiplication, solving the goal.
  -- The error "no goals to be solved" at the `norm_num` line indicates that the goal was already solved by the preceding `simp` tactic.
  -- Therefore, the `norm_num` tactic is redundant and is removed.
  -- norm_num -- Removed as per message
