  (f : ℚ → ℝ)
  (h₀ : ∀x>0, ∀y>0, f (x * y) = f x + f y)
  (h₁ : ∀p, Nat.Prime p → f p = p) :
  f (25 / 11) < 0 := by

  -- The goal is to show f(25/11) < 0.
  -- We expect f(25/11) = f(25) - f(11) based on h₀.
  -- We expect f(25) = f(5*5) = f(5) + f(5).
  -- We expect f(p) = p for prime p based on h₁. So f(5) = 5 and f(11) = 11.
  -- This calculation suggests f(25/11) = (5+5) - 11 = 10 - 11 = -1, which is indeed less than 0.
  -- We will formalize these steps in Lean4.

  -- Step 1: Prove the division property of f: f(x/y) = f(x) - f(y) for positive x, y.
  -- Let x y be positive rational numbers.

    -- The hypothesis h₀ allows us to split f of a product into a sum, provided both factors are positive.
    -- We are given hy : y > 0. We need to show that x / y > 0.

    have h_applied_h0 : f ((x / y) * y) = f (x / y) + f y := h₀ (x / y) hxy_pos y hy

    -- We know that for rational numbers, (x / y) * y = x when y ≠ 0.
    -- Since hy : y > 0, y is nonzero.
    -- Added an explicit step to prove the equality (x/y) * y = x in ℚ.
    have h_mul_div : (x / y) * y = x := by field_simp [hy.ne']

    -- Rewrite the left side of h_applied_h0 using the equality h_mul_div.
    -- This transforms `f ((x / y) * y) = f (x / y) + f y` into `f x = f (x / y) + f y`.
    -- Modified the line to use rw with the newly proved equality h_mul_div.
    rw [h_mul_div] at h_applied_h0

    -- The hypothesis is now h_applied_h0 : f x = f (x / y) + f y.
    -- The goal is f (x / y) = f x - f y.
    -- We can rearrange the hypothesis algebraically.
    -- f x - f y = (f (x / y) + f y) - f y
    -- Added steps to perform algebraic manipulation using equality and ring.
    have h_subtract_fy : f x - f y = (f (x / y) + f y) - f y := by rw [h_applied_h0]

    -- Replace the right side of h_subtract_fy with the simplified form.

    -- The current state is h_subtract_fy : f x - f y = f (x / y).
    -- The goal is f (x / y) = f x - f y.

    -- The goal is now exactly the hypothesis.
    -- Modified the final step to use the derived equality.

  -- Step 2: Apply the derived division property to f(25/11).
  -- We need to verify that 25 and 11 are positive rational numbers.

  have h11_pos : (11 : ℚ) > 0 := by norm_num
  -- Use the h_div lemma with x = 25 and y = 11.
  -- The previous code had an incorrect explicit type annotation here which caused an error.
  -- The types (25 : ℚ) and (11 : ℚ) are correctly inferred from the target f (25 / 11).
  -- We only need to provide the proofs of positivity h25_pos and h11_pos.

  -- The hypothesis h₁ tells us the value of f for prime numbers.
  -- We verify that 11 is a prime number.
  have h11_prime : Nat.Prime 11 := by decide

  -- have h11_val' : f (11 : ℚ) = 11 := by exact h11_val -- This step is redundant as h11_val is sufficient.

  -- Step 4: Evaluate f(25). 25 is not prime, so h₁ cannot be applied directly.
  -- We know that 25 is 5 * 5. We can use h₀ to evaluate f(5*5).
  -- First, represent the equality 25 = 5 * 5 in terms of rational numbers.

  -- Apply h₀ to f(5 * 5).
  -- f(25 : ℚ) is definitionally equal to f((5 : ℚ) * (5 : ℚ)) by h25_eq_5_mul_5.
  -- We apply h₀ to (5 : ℚ) and (5 : ℚ).
  -- Corrected the type annotation in the statement of the have lemma in the original code comment. It should be f((5 : ℚ) * (5 : ℚ)) not f(5 : ℚ * 5 : ℚ).
  have hf25_sum : f ((5 : ℚ) * (5 : ℚ)) = f (5 : ℚ) + f (5 : ℚ) := h₀ (5 : ℚ) h5_pos (5 : ℚ) h5_pos
  -- Now, using h25_eq_5_mul_5, we can state f(25 : ℚ) = f(5 : ℚ) + f(5 : ℚ).
  -- -- The previous attempt to rewrite (25 : ℚ) in hf25_sum failed because (25 : ℚ) does not appear there.
  -- -- We need to rewrite (5 : ℚ) * (5 : ℚ) as (25 : ℚ) using the reverse of h25_eq_5_mul_5.
  have hf25_val_intermediate : f (25 : ℚ) = f (5 : ℚ) + f (5 : ℚ) := by rw [← h25_eq_5_mul_5] at hf25_sum; exact hf25_sum


  -- Step 5: Evaluate f(5). 5 is a prime number.
  -- Use h₁ again for the prime number 5.

  -- Apply h₁ with p = 5.
  have h5_val : f (5 : ℚ) = (5 : ℝ) := h₁ 5 h5_prime
  -- Explicit real value.
  -- have h5_val' : f (5 : ℚ) = 5 := by exact h5_val -- This step is redundant.

  -- Step 6: Substitute the value of f(5) back into the expression for f(25).
  -- We have hf25_val_intermediate : f (25 : ℚ) = f (5 : ℚ) + f (5 : ℚ).
  -- We know h5_val : f (5 : ℚ) = (5 : ℝ).
  -- We want to prove f (25 : ℚ) = (5 : ℝ) + (5 : ℝ).
  -- We can rewrite the goal using the hypotheses.

    -- We have hf25_val_intermediate : f (25 : ℚ) = f (5 : ℚ) + f (5 : ℚ)

    -- We need to replace both occurrences of f (5 : ℚ) with (5 : ℝ).
    -- Instead of using two separate 'rw' calls, we can use 'simp' with the equality h5_val.
    -- The original code had two 'rw [h5_val]' lines, which caused the "no goals to be solved" message on the second one.
    -- Using 'simp' allows substituting multiple occurrences at once.
    simp [h5_val]
    -- The goal becomes (5 : ℝ) + (5 : ℝ) = (5 : ℝ) + (5 : ℝ).
    -- 'simp' is usually sufficient to solve such reflexivity goals.
    -- The previous 'rfl' is now redundant as 'simp' solves the equality.

  have h_final : (-1 : ℝ) < 0 := by norm_num

  -- The final goal `f (25 / 11) < 0` is exactly the inequality we proved in the last step.
  -- We have f(25/11) = -1 (h_eval) and -1 < 0 (h_final).
  -- We need to rewrite the goal using the equality h_eval, and then use h_final to prove the resulting inequality.
  -- The previous code attempted to directly use `exact h_final`, which caused a type mismatch because the goal `f (25 / 11) < 0`
  -- is not definitionally equal to `-(1 : ℝ) < 0`.
  rw [h_eval] -- Rewrite f(25/11) as -1 in the goal.
  exact h_final -- Now the goal is -1 < 0, which is exactly what h_final states.
