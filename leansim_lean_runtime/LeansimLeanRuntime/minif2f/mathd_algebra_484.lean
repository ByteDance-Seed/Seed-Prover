theorem mathd_algebra_484 :
  Real.log 27 / Real.log 3 = 3 := by 
 
  -- The goal is Real.log 27 / Real.log 3 = 3
  -- We know that 27 = 3^3. We can use the property of logarithms: log(a^b) = b * log(a).
  -- This means Real.log 27 = Real.log (3^3) = 3 * Real.log 3.
  -- The expression then becomes (3 * Real.log 3) / Real.log 3.
  -- If Real.log 3 is not zero, this simplifies to 3.

  -- Step 1: Show that 27 equals 3 to the power of 3 in the context of real numbers.
  have h27_pow : (27 : ℝ) = (3 : ℝ) ^ 3 := by
    norm_num -- This tactic handles numerical equalities.

  -- Rewrite Real.log 27 using the fact that 27 = 3^3.
  rw [h27_pow]
  -- The goal is now Real.log (3 ^ 3) / Real.log 3 = 3

  -- Step 2: Apply the logarithm power rule: Real.log (x^n) = (n : ℝ) * Real.log x.
  -- The theorem in Mathlib is `Real.log_pow {x : ℝ} (n : ℕ) : log (x ^ n) = (n : ℝ) * log x`.
  -- Here, x is 3 and n is 3.
  -- The theorem `Real.log_pow` takes `x : ℝ` and `n : ℕ` as explicit arguments.
  -- The previous attempt `Real.log_pow (x := (3 : ℝ)) h3_pos 3` had the wrong arguments due to a misunderstanding of the theorem signature.
  have hlog_27_expanded : Real.log ((3 : ℝ) ^ 3) = (3 : ℝ) * Real.log (3 : ℝ) :=
    Real.log_pow (3 : ℝ) 3 -- Correct application of Real.log_pow with arguments x : ℝ and n : ℕ.

  -- Rewrite the numerator in the goal using the expanded form.
  rw [hlog_27_expanded]
  -- The goal is now ((3 : ℝ) * Real.log 3) / Real.log 3 = 3

  -- Step 3: Show that the denominator Real.log 3 is not zero.
  -- The theorem `Real.eq_one_of_pos_of_log_eq_zero {x : ℝ} (hx : 0 < x) : log x = 0 → x = 1` tells us that for positive x, log x = 0 implies x = 1.
  -- The previous code used `Real.log_eq_zero_iff_eq_one` which does not exist. The correct theorem is `Real.eq_one_of_pos_of_log_eq_zero`.
  -- For x = 3 (which is > 0), Real.log 3 = 0 implies 3 = 1.
  -- Since 3 is not equal to 1, Real.log 3 is not zero (by contrapositive).
  have h3_pos : (3 : ℝ) > 0 := by
    norm_num -- This proves the inequality 3 > 0.
  have h3_ne_1 : (3 : ℝ) ≠ 1 := by
    norm_num -- This proves the inequality 3 ≠ 1.

  -- Deduce Real.log 3 ≠ 0 from 3 ≠ 1 using `Real.eq_one_of_pos_of_log_eq_zero`.
  -- `Real.eq_one_of_pos_of_log_eq_zero h3_pos` gives the implication `Real.log 3 = 0 → 3 = 1`.
  -- We have `h3_ne_1 : 3 ≠ 1`. By modus tollens (mt), we get `Real.log 3 ≠ 0`.
  have hlog_3_ne_0 : Real.log (3 : ℝ) ≠ 0 :=
    mt (Real.eq_one_of_pos_of_log_eq_zero h3_pos) h3_ne_1 -- Used the existing theorem `Real.eq_one_of_pos_of_log_eq_zero` and modus tollens `mt`.

  -- Step 4: Simplify the fraction using the fact that Real.log 3 is non-zero.
  -- We have an expression of the form (c * y) / y where y ≠ 0. This simplifies to c.
  -- The `field_simp` tactic is suitable for simplifying expressions in fields, taking non-zero denominators into account.
  field_simp [hlog_3_ne_0] -- Simplify the fraction, using hlog_3_ne_0 for the non-zero denominator.
  -- The goal is now (3 : ℝ) = 3. The field_simp tactic simplifies the left side of the equality
  -- to `3 : ℝ`. Lean's kernel then automatically recognizes that `(3 : ℝ) = 3` holds.
  -- The remaining equality (3 : ℝ) = 3 is trivial and is automatically solved by Lean after field_simp.

  -- Step 5: The remaining equality is a trivial identity.
  -- The goal was already solved by the previous tactic `field_simp`.
  -- rfl -- Removed redundant tactic as the goal was already solved.
