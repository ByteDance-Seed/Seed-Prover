theorem mathd_numbertheory_299 :
  (1 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 9 * 11 * 13) % 10 = 5 := by 
  -- The goal is to prove that the product (1 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 9 * 11 * 13) modulo 10 is 5.
  -- The product is 1 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 9 * 11 * 13 = 135135.
  -- We need to show that 135135 mod 10 is 5.
  -- The modulo operation for natural numbers in Lean 4 is `Nat.mod`, which is denoted by `%`.
  -- This is a direct numerical calculation that can be handled by the `norm_num` tactic.
  norm_num
  -- The `norm_num` tactic evaluates the numerical expression (1 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 9 * 11 * 13) % 10
  -- and simplifies it to 5, proving the equality 5 = 5.
