  -- The goal is to show that k is greater than or equal to 5.
  -- We will prove this by contradiction. Assume that k is less than 5.
  -- The 'intro' tactic is used to introduce variables from implications or universal quantifications in the goal.
  -- Since the goal is a simple proposition (5 ≤ k), we need to use 'by_contra' to assume the negation of the goal for a proof by contradiction.

  -- Since k is a natural number and 0 < k, and we assume k < 5, k must be one of {1, 2, 3, 4}.
  -- We use the given hypothesis h₀ : 0 < k to establish the lower bound.
  -- We use the assumption h_not_goal : ¬ (5 ≤ k) which is k < 5 to establish the upper bound.

  -- The original line attempted to use `Nat.pos_iff_one_le` which was reported as an unknown constant.
  -- We derive `1 ≤ k` from `h₀ : 0 < k` using the `mpr` direction of `Nat.succ_le_iff`.
  -- `Nat.succ_le_iff` states `succ n ≤ m ↔ n < m`. Setting `n=0` and `m=k`, this becomes `succ 0 ≤ k ↔ 0 < k`, which is `1 ≤ k ↔ 0 < k`.
  -- The `mpr` direction is `0 < k → 1 ≤ k`.

  -- We split the proof into cases for k = 1, k = 2, k = 3, and k = 4.
  -- We use the 'interval_cases' tactic with the bounds derived from our hypotheses.
  -- The syntax for providing hypotheses to `interval_cases` is `using h₁, h₂`.
  -- We now use the derived hypotheses `hk_ge_1 : 1 ≤ k` and `hk_le_4 : k ≤ 4` as the bounds.
