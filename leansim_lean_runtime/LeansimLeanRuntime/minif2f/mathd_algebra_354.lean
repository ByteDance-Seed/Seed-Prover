  -- We are given two linear equations:
  -- h₀ : a + 6 * d = 30
  -- h₁ : a + 10 * d = 60
  -- We want to prove a third linear equation:
  -- a + 20 * d = 135

  -- Step 1: Derive a relationship for 'd' by subtracting the two equations.
  -- Rewrite h₁ to isolate the term (a + 6 * d).

    -- This is a linear equation, and the equality follows from the commutative property of addition.
    -- The 'linarith' tactic can solve linear arithmetic goals using hypotheses.
    -- The original code attempted a manual rewrite using add_comm, which failed because the rewrite pattern was not found in the target.
    -- Using linarith is simpler as it handles the commutative property and uses the hypothesis h₁.

  -- Simplify the left side: (14/4) * (4 * d) = 14 * d.
  -- The left side is (14/4) * (4 * d). We use mul_assoc in reverse to group (14/4) and 4.

  -- Step 3: Prove the goal a + 20 * d = 135 using h₀ and h₃.
