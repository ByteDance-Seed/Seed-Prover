  -- The "unsolved goals" message after 'intro heq' indicates that the assumption 'heq' has been introduced,

  -- The code below provides the necessary steps to reach the contradiction.

  -- The equality p * q - (p + q) = 194 implies that p + q ≤ p * q for the natural number subtraction to be well-defined.

    -- Assume p * q < p + q for contradiction (this is the negation of the goal p + q ≤ p * q).

    -- By definition of natural number subtraction, if p*q < p+q, then p*q - (p+q) = 0.
    -- The hypothesis h_contra is ¬(p + q ≤ p * q). Nat.sub_eq_zero_of_le requires p*q <= p+q.
    -- le_of_lt converts p*q < p+q to p*q <= p+q.
    -- The previous error indicated a type mismatch for the argument h_contra passed to le_of_lt.
    -- This is because by_contra introduces the negation ¬(p + q ≤ p * q), which is different from p * q < p + q although equivalent for Nat.
