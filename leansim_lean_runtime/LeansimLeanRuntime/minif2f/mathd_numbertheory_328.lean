theorem mathd_numbertheory_328 :
  (5^999999) % 7 = 6 := by 
  -- The goal is to compute the remainder of 5 raised to the power of 999999 when divided by 7.
  -- This is a direct numerical computation problem involving exponentiation and the modulo operator on natural numbers.
  -- The `norm_num` tactic is specifically designed to evaluate such numerical expressions and prove equalities or inequalities between them.
  -- We apply `norm_num` to perform the computation and verify the result.
