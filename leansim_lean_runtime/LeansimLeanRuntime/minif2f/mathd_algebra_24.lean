theorem mathd_algebra_24
  (x : ℝ)
  (h₀ : x / 50 = 40) :
  x = 2000 := by 
  -- The given hypothesis is x / 50 = 40. The goal is to show x = 2000.
  -- We can solve for x by multiplying both sides of the equation by 50.
  -- In a field (like ℝ), the equation a / b = c is equivalent to a = c * b, provided b ≠ 0.
  -- Here, a is x, b is 50, and c is 40.
  -- We first need to show that 50 is not zero in ℝ.
  have h_50_nonzero : (50 : ℝ) ≠ 0 := by
    -- norm_num can verify this numerical inequality.

  -- Now we can use the equivalence `div_eq_iff_mul_eq` to rewrite the hypothesis `h₀`.
  -- `div_eq_iff_mul_eq h_50_nonzero` states that x / 50 = 40 is equivalent to 40 * 50 = x.
  -- The theorem `div_eq_iff_mul_eq` is of the form `b ≠ 0 → (a / b = c ↔ c * b = a)`.
  -- We apply this theorem with `a := x`, `b := 50`, `c := 40` and the hypothesis `h_50_nonzero`.
  -- We use `rw [...] at h₀` to rewrite `h₀` using the backward direction of the equivalence (if A ↔ B, rw A changes it to B).
  -- `x / 50 = 40 ↔ 40 * 50 = x`. Rewriting `x / 50 = 40` using this means replacing it with `40 * 50 = x`.
  -- The theorem `div_eq_iff_mul_eq` is in `GroupWithZero` which `ℝ` is.
  rw [div_eq_iff_mul_eq h_50_nonzero] at h₀
  -- The hypothesis `h₀` is now `40 * 50 = x`.
  -- The goal is `x = 2000`.
  -- We can use the rewritten hypothesis `h₀` to replace `x` in the goal. Note that the equality is symmetric, so `40 * 50 = x` is the same as `x = 40 * 50`.
  -- We want to replace `x` in the goal with its value from `h₀`. Since `x` is on the right side of `h₀`, we use `rw [← h₀]` to apply the equality in the reverse direction.
  rw [← h₀]
  -- The goal is now `40 * 50 = 2000`.
  -- This is a simple numerical equality.
  -- norm_num can evaluate this expression.
