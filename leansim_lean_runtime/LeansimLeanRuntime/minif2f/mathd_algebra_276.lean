  -- The hypothesis h₀ states that the polynomial 10*x^2 - x - 24 = (a*x - 8)*(b*x + 3)
  -- holds for all real numbers x. Since ℝ is an infinite field, this implies the two polynomials
  -- are equal as polynomials over ℝ.

  -- Define the left-hand side polynomial over ℝ[X].
  -- The polynomial 10*x^2 - x - 24 is represented as 10*X^2 - 1*X - 24 in ℝ[X].
  -- The constant term -24 must be embedded into the polynomial ring using Polynomial.C
  -- We use the definitionally equivalent form `Polynomial.C s * p`.
  -- -- The message "unsolved goals" appearing here indicates that the goal is still unsolved after processing this line.
  -- -- This is expected as defining a variable ('let') does not solve the goal. The proof proceeds after this.
  -- -- While the line itself is syntactically correct, we apply minor formatting and syntax adjustments for clarity.
  -- -- Moved the 'let' statement to the next line for standard formatting.
  -- -- Simplified the constant term coercion syntax from `((-24) : ℝ)` to `(-24 : ℝ)`.
  -- -- The original code placed the 'let' statement on the same line as `:= by`. This is syntactically incorrect in Lean 4.
  -- -- We move the `let` statement to the next line, properly indented within the `by` block.

  -- Define the right-hand side polynomial over ℝ[X] by expanding (a*x - 8)*(b*x + 3).
  -- Expanding gives (a*b)*x^2 + (3*a - 8*b)*x - 24.
  -- The coefficients are (a*b), (3*a - 8*b), and -24, interpreted as elements of ℝ.
  -- We use the definitionally equivalent form `Polynomial.C s * p`.
  -- We make the coefficients explicit products/sums of coerced integers using `(a : ℝ) * (b : ℝ)`, etc.
  -- -- Corrected the coefficient of X^2: `Polynomial.C Polynomial.X^2` was incorrect, it should be just `Polynomial.X^2`.
  -- -- Standardized the constant term coercion syntax from `-(24 : ℝ)` to `-24 : ℝ`.

  -- Since they agree on all points (by h₀), they agree on an infinite set (ℝ itself).
  -- We need to show that the evaluation of p_lhs equals the evaluation of p_rhs_expanded.
