  (h₀ : x ≠ 0) :
  12 / (x * x) * (x^4 / (14 * x)) * (35 / (3 * x)) = 10 := by 
  -- The goal is an equality in the field of real numbers.
  -- We are given that x is non-zero, which is required for division by x.
  -- The expression involves products and divisions of terms involving x.
  -- `field_simp` is a tactic that simplifies expressions in fields by combining
  -- fractions and clearing denominators in equalities.
  -- It requires the denominators to be non-zero. The denominators are x*x, 14*x, 3*x.
  -- Given h₀ : x ≠ 0, we know x*x ≠ 0, 14*x ≠ 0, and 3*x ≠ 0.
  -- field_simp can use h₀ to justify this.
  field_simp [h₀]
  -- After applying field_simp, the goal has been transformed into an equality of polynomials in x:
  -- 12 * x^4 * 35 = 10 * (x * x * (14 * x) * (3 * x))
  -- This is a polynomial identity.
  -- The `ring` tactic can prove polynomial identities over commutative rings.
