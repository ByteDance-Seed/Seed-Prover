  x = 89 := by 
 
  -- We need to find the largest two-digit number x such that 9x ends with 01.
  -- This translates to solving the congruence 9x ≡ 1 (mod 100).
  -- The multiplicative inverse of 9 modulo 100 is 89, since 9 * 89 = 801 ≡ 1 (mod 100).
  -- Therefore, x ≡ 89 (mod 100). Since x is a two-digit number, x = 89.
  interval_cases x <;> norm_num at h₁ ⊢ <;> omega
  -- The `interval_cases` tactic systematically checks each possible value of x in the range 10 ≤ x ≤ 99.
  -- The `norm_num` tactic simplifies the numerical expressions and checks the congruence condition.
  -- The `omega` tactic is used to solve the resulting linear arithmetic problems.
