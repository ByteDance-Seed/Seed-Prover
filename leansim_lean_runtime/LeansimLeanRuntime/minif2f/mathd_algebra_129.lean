  (a : ℝ)
  (h₀ : a ≠ 0)
  (h₁ : 8⁻¹ / 4⁻¹ - a⁻¹ = 1) :
  a = -2 := by 
 
  -- The hypothesis h₁ is 8⁻¹ / 4⁻¹ - a⁻¹ = 1. We want to show a = -2.
  -- First, simplify the term 8⁻¹ / 4⁻¹.
  -- Using the property x⁻¹ / y⁻¹ = y / x for non-zero x, y in a division monoid (like ℝ).
  -- 8⁻¹ / 4⁻¹ = 4 / 8
  rw [inv_div_inv (8:ℝ) (4:ℝ)] at h₁
  -- The equation h₁ is now (4 : ℝ) / (8 : ℝ) - a⁻¹ = 1.
  -- Simplify the numerical fraction 4/8.
  norm_num at h₁
  -- The equation h₁ is now (1 / 2 : ℝ) - a⁻¹ = 1.
  -- Rearrange this linear equation in terms of a⁻¹ to isolate a⁻¹.
  -- From (1/2) - a⁻¹ = 1, we get a⁻¹ = (1/2) - 1. We use linarith for this step.
  have h₂ : a⁻¹ = (1 / 2 : ℝ) - 1 := by linarith [h₁]
  -- Simplify the numerical expression (1/2) - 1.
  norm_num at h₂
  -- The equation h₂ is now a⁻¹ = -1 / 2.
  -- We want to solve for a. We can take the inverse of both sides.
  -- The lemma inv_eq_iff_eq_inv states a⁻¹ = b ↔ a = b⁻¹. We use this to rewrite h₂.
  -- The rewrite tactic `rw` requires an equality or iff proof. The previous code passed `h₃` which was a non-equality.
  -- The theorem `inv_eq_iff_eq_inv` itself is the iff proof needed for the rewrite.
  -- have h₃ : (-1 / 2 : ℝ) ≠ 0 := by norm_num -- This hypothesis is not needed for `rw [inv_eq_iff_eq_inv]`
  rw [inv_eq_iff_eq_inv] at h₂
  -- The equation h₂ is now a = (-1 / 2 : ℝ)⁻¹.
  -- Simplify the inverse of -1/2.
  norm_num at h₂
  -- The equation h₂ is now a = -2.
  -- This is the desired conclusion.
