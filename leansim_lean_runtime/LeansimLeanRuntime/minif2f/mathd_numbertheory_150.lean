  (n : ℕ)
  (h₀ : ¬ Nat.Prime (7 + 30 * n)) :
  6 ≤ n := by 
  -- We prove the contrapositive by assuming the negation of the conclusion (n < 6)
  -- and deriving a contradiction with the hypothesis (¬ Nat.Prime (7 + 30 * n)).
  by_contra hn
  -- The negation of `6 ≤ n` for a natural number `n` is `n < 6`.
  -- So we have a hypothesis `hn : ¬(6 ≤ n)`.
  -- This means that `n` must be one of the natural numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
  -- We can proceed by splitting the proof into cases for each possible value of `n`.

  -- The tactic `interval_cases n : hn` failed, possibly due to syntax issues or
  -- interaction with the `by_contra` hypothesis depending on `n`.
  -- We will achieve the same effect by converting `n < 6` to membership in a finite set
  -- and using `fin_cases`.

  -- The hypothesis `hn : ¬ (6 ≤ n)` is equivalent to `n < 6` for natural numbers.
  -- We use Nat.not_le which states `¬ a ≤ b ↔ b < a`.
  -- Applying this to `hn : ¬(6 ≤ n)` gives `n < 6`.
  -- We use Nat.lt_succ_iff which states `m < succ k ↔ m ≤ k`.
  -- Instantiating with `m = n` and `k = 5`, we get `n < succ 5 ↔ n ≤ 5`, which is `n < 6 ↔ n ≤ 5`.
  -- Combining these, `¬(6 ≤ n)` is equivalent to `n ≤ 5`.

  -- The theorem `Nat.lt_succ_iff_le` does not exist. The correct theorem is `Nat.lt_succ_iff`.
  have hn_le_five : n ≤ 5 := by
    -- The original `rwa` failed because the hypothesis `hn` was `¬(6 ≤ n)`, not directly in the form `m < succ k`.
    -- We first rewrite `hn : ¬(6 ≤ n)` to `hn : n < 6` using `Nat.not_le`.
    rw [Nat.not_le] at hn
    -- Now that `hn` is `n < 6`, we can rewrite it to `n ≤ 5` using `Nat.lt_succ_iff`.
    rw [Nat.lt_succ_iff] at hn
    -- The goal `n ≤ 5` is now exactly the hypothesis `hn`, so we can use `exact hn`.
    exact hn

  -- The original line `have h_equiv : n ∈ Finset.range (Nat.succ 5) ↔ n ≤ 5 := Finset.mem_range_succ_iff n 5` caused a "function expected" error.
  -- This error seems to be related to how implicit arguments were handled by the proof term `Finset.mem_range_succ_iff n 5`.
  -- We explicitly provide the arguments `a` and `b` to `Finset.mem_range_succ_iff` to ensure Lean can apply the theorem correctly.
  have h_equiv : n ∈ Finset.range (Nat.succ 5) ↔ n ≤ 5 := Finset.mem_range_succ_iff (a := n) (b := 5) -- Explicitly apply the theorem by naming the implicit arguments.

  -- The hypothesis `n ≤ 5` means that `n` must be one of the values in the finite set `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`.
  -- We can express membership in this set using `Finset.range 6`.
  -- Use the theorem `Finset.mem_range_succ_iff` which states `a ∈ range b.succ ↔ a ≤ b`.
  -- Setting a=n and b=5, we get `n ∈ Finset.range (5 + 1) ↔ n ≤ 5`. Since we have `n ≤ 5` (hn_le_five), we use the reverse implication (mpr).
  -- The original line `have hn_mem_range : n ∈ Finset.range 6 := (Finset.mem_range_succ_iff n 5).mpr hn_le_five` also caused an error, likely related to the same issue with the application of the theorem.
  -- Since we now have `h_equiv : n ∈ Finset.range (Nat.succ 5) ↔ n ≤ 5` proven, we can use it directly.
  have hn_mem_range : n ∈ Finset.range 6 := by
    -- We have `h_equiv : n ∈ Finset.range (Nat.succ 5) ↔ n ≤ 5`
    -- We have `hn_le_five : n ≤ 5`
    -- We want to prove `n ∈ Finset.range 6`.
    -- Since `Finset.range (Nat.succ 5)` is definitionally equal to `Finset.range 6`, the goal is definitionally `n ∈ Finset.range (Nat.succ 5)`.
    -- We can use the `.mpr` direction of `h_equiv`.
    exact h_equiv.mpr hn_le_five

  -- Now use the `fin_cases` tactic to split the goal into cases based on the possible values of `n` in the finite set `Finset.range 6`.
  fin_cases hn_mem_range

  -- The `fin_cases` tactic generates subgoals for each element `k` in `Finset.range 6`, with the hypothesis `n = k`.
  -- The context also contains `h₀ : ¬ Nat.Prime (7 + 30 * n)`, which becomes `h₀ : ¬ Nat.Prime (7 + 30 * k)` in each case.
  -- The goal in each case is `False`. We need to derive `False` from `h₀` by proving `Nat.Prime (7 + 30 * k)`.

    -- Need to prove `Nat.Prime (7 + 30 * 3)`.
    apply h₀ -- Apply the contradictory hypothesis h₀. Goal becomes `Nat.Prime (7 + 30 * 3)`.

  -- Case n = 4 (implicitly handled by fin_cases when n = 4)
  . -- Goal: `False`. Context: `n = 4`, `h₀ : ¬ Nat.Prime (7 + 30 * 4)`.
    -- Need to prove `Nat.Prime (7 + 30 * 4)`.
    apply h₀ -- Apply the contradictory hypothesis h₀. Goal becomes `Nat.Prime (7 + 30 * 4)`.
    norm_num -- Evaluate the number. Goal becomes `Nat.Prime 127`.
    -- `norm_num` can solve `Nat.Prime 127`.

    -- `norm_num` can solve `Nat.Prime 157`.
    -- decide -- The goal `Nat.Prime 157` was already solved by `norm_num`.

  -- All cases have led to a contradiction, so the original assumption `¬ (6 ≤ n)` must be false.
  -- Therefore, `6 ≤ n` must be true.
