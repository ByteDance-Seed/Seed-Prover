  -- The hypothesis is h₀ : 3 / 2 / 3 = x / 10.
  -- Use field_simp to simplify the fractions in the hypothesis.
  -- field_simp simplifies the equation by clearing denominators.
  -- (3/2)/3 = x/10 becomes (3/6) = x/10 which simplifies to 1/2 = x/10.
  -- Then field_simp clears denominators from 1/2 = x/10, resulting in 1 * 10 = x * 2.
  -- Looking at the error message, field_simp seems to have simplified (3/2)/3 = x/10 to 3 * 10 = x * (2 * 3) directly.
  field_simp at h₀
  -- After field_simp, the hypothesis h₀ is (3 : ℝ) * (10 : ℝ) = x * ((2 : ℝ) * (3 : ℝ)).

  -- The previous proof attempted to use div_eq_div_iff after field_simp, but the hypothesis was no longer in the a/b = c/d form.
  -- We continue by simplifying the equation obtained from field_simp.

  -- Simplify the left side: 3 * 10 = 30.
  have h_lhs_simp : (3 : ℝ) * (10 : ℝ) = 30 := by norm_num
  rw [h_lhs_simp] at h₀
  -- h₀ is now 30 = x * ((2 : ℝ) * (3 : ℝ)).

  -- Simplify the right side's multiplication: 2 * 3 = 6.
  have h_rhs_simp : ((2 : ℝ) * (3 : ℝ)) = 6 := by norm_num
  rw [h_rhs_simp] at h₀
  -- h₀ is now 30 = x * 6.

  -- Rewrite 30 as 5 * 6 to prepare for cancellation.
  have h_30_eq : (30 : ℝ) = 5 * 6 := by norm_num
  rw [h_30_eq] at h₀
  -- h₀ is now 5 * 6 = x * 6.

  -- Use mul_right_cancel_by_nonzero to cancel the common factor 6 from both sides.
  -- This theorem states a * c = b * c ↔ a = b if c ≠ 0.
  -- We need 6 ≠ 0.
  have h_6_nonzero : (6 : ℝ) ≠ 0 := by norm_num

  -- The previous line used `rw` with an iff proof `mul_right_cancel_by_nonzero h_6_nonzero`,
  -- which caused the error "equality or iff proof expected".
  -- Although `mul_right_cancel_by_nonzero` returns an iff, applying it with `rw` in this
  -- specific context failed.
  -- Instead, we use the direct implication theorem `mul_right_cancel`, which states
  -- `a * c = b * c → a = b` for `c ≠ 0` in a ring with no zero divisors like ℝ.
  -- Our hypothesis is h₀ : (5 : ℝ) * (6 : ℝ) = x * (6 : ℝ).
  -- mul_right_cancel h_6_nonzero h₀ applies the theorem to h₀ given h_6_nonzero,
  -- proving that (5 : ℝ) = x.
  -- The error "application type mismatch" on `mul_right_cancel h_6_nonzero h₀`
  -- indicates that the `mul_right_cancel` theorem found does not take the non-zero
  -- hypothesis as the first argument. The hint suggests `mul_right_cancel₀` which
  -- has the signature `b ≠ 0 → a * b = c * b → a = c`. This matches the user's
  -- intended argument order `h_6_nonzero` then `h₀`. We replace `mul_right_cancel`
  -- with `mul_right_cancel₀`.
  -- have h₁ : (5 : ℝ) = x := mul_right_cancel h_6_nonzero h₀ -- Original buggy line
  have h₁ : (5 : ℝ) = x := mul_right_cancel₀ h_6_nonzero h₀ -- Corrected using mul_right_cancel₀

  -- The goal is x = 5. The hypothesis h₁ is 5 = x. These are equivalent by symmetry.
