  -- To prove the goal, we can rewrite using 'result' and then show that (72 : ℝ) / (6 : ℝ) = 12.
  -- The previous code tried to use `final_res : (72 : ℕ) / (6 : ℕ) = (12 : ℕ)`, but this equality for natural numbers
  -- cannot be directly applied to rewrite the goal involving real number division.
