  (n : ℕ)
  (h₀ : n % 5 = 3) :
  (2 * n) % 5 = 1 := by 
  -- We are given the hypothesis h₀ : n % 5 = 3.
  -- In Lean 4, a ≡ b [MOD n] is definitionally a % n = b % n.
  -- So, n ≡ 3 [MOD 5] is definitionally n % 5 = 3 % 5.
  -- We know n % 5 = 3 (h₀) and 3 % 5 = 3 (by norm_num).
  -- Thus, n % 5 = 3 % 5 follows from h₀.
  -- We can directly use h₀ as a modular congruence hypothesis n ≡ 3 [MOD 5].

  -- The goal is to prove (2 * n) % 5 = 1.

  -- We can use the property that if a ≡ b [MOD m], then c * a ≡ c * b [MOD m].
  -- In Lean, this property is captured by the theorem `Nat.ModEq.mul_left`.
  -- Applying this theorem with c = 2, from h₀ : n % 5 = 3 (which is n ≡ 3 [MOD 5] by definition),
  -- we can deduce 2 * n ≡ 2 * 3 [MOD 5].
  -- -- Corrected the typo in the theorem name from `Nat.Modeq.mul_left` to `Nat.ModEq.mul_left`.
  have h₁ : 2 * n ≡ 2 * 3 [MOD 5] := Nat.ModEq.mul_left 2 h₀

  -- Now h₁ is 2 * n ≡ 2 * 3 [MOD 5], which is definitionally (2 * n) % 5 = (2 * 3) % 5.
  -- Simplify the right side of the congruence using simp.
  -- `simp` evaluates `2 * 3` to 6.
  -- `simp at h₁` simplifies h₁ to `(2 * n) % 5 = 6 % 5`.
  -- -- `simp at h₁` simplifies the expression in the type of h₁.
  simp at h₁

  -- Now h₁ is (2 * n) % 5 = 6 % 5.
  -- We know that 6 % 5 equals 1. Let's prove this fact using `norm_num`.
  -- -- Evaluate 6 % 5.
  have h₂ : 6 % 5 = 1 := by
    norm_num

  -- We want to show (2 * n) % 5 = 1.
  -- From h₁, we have (2 * n) % 5 = 6 % 5.
  -- From h₂, we have 6 % 5 = 1.
  -- By transitivity of equality, (2 * n) % 5 = 1.
  -- We can achieve this by rewriting the goal `(2 * n) % 5 = 1` using `h₁` and then `h₂`.

  -- -- The previous steps `rw [h₁]` and `exact h₂` have been replaced by a single `rw [h₁, h₂]` for conciseness. The "no goals to be solved" message on the `exact h₂` line indicated that the proof was successfully completed by that step, so combining the last steps is a minor stylistic improvement.
