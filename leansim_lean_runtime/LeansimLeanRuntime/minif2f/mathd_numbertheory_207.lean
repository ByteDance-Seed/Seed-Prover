theorem mathd_numbertheory_207 :
  8 * 9^2 + 5 * 9 + 2 = 695 := by 
  -- The goal is a simple arithmetic equality involving multiplication, squaring, and addition of integers.
  -- The `ring` tactic is suitable for proving such equalities in commutative rings like the integers.
  -- We can directly apply `ring` to verify the equality.
  ring
  -- The `ring` tactic evaluates the expression 8 * 9^2 + 5 * 9 + 2 and checks if it equals 695.
  -- 8 * 81 + 45 + 2 = 648 + 45 + 2 = 693 + 2 = 695.
  -- The tactic confirms the equality.
