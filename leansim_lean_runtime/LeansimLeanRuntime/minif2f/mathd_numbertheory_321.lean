  (h₁ : n = 160⁻¹) :
  n = 1058 := by 
  -- The goal is to show that n is equal to 1058.
  -- We are given the hypothesis h₁ that n is equal to the inverse of 160 in ZMod 1399.
  -- We can substitute h₁ into the goal.
  rw [h₁]
  -- The goal is now to prove that 160⁻¹ = 1058 in ZMod 1399.
  -- To show that b is the inverse of a, it suffices to show that a * b = 1,
  -- provided a has an inverse (which 160 does in ZMod 1399 because 1399 is prime and 160 is not a multiple of 1399).
  -- We can use the theorem `ZMod.inv_eq_of_mul_eq_one`.
  -- This theorem states that if `a * b = 1` in `ZMod n`, then `a⁻¹ = b`.
  -- We apply this theorem with a = 160 and b = 1058.
  apply ZMod.inv_eq_of_mul_eq_one
  -- The new goal is to prove that `(160 * 1058 : ZMod 1399) = 1`.
  -- We can use the `norm_num` tactic to compute the value of `160 * 1058` in `ZMod 1399`.
  -- The calculation is 160 * 1058 = 169280.
  -- We need to check what 169280 is modulo 1399.
  -- 169280 = 121 * 1399 + 1.
  -- So, 169280 is congruent to 1 modulo 1399.
  -- The `norm_num` tactic performs this calculation.
  norm_num
  -- The goal is now `(1 : ZMod 1399) = 1`.
  -- This is true by definition.
