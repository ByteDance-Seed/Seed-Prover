  -- The goal is to prove `f 4 = -1`.
  -- We are given two conditions for the function `f`, one for odd integers and one for even integers.
  -- We need to determine if the input `4` is odd or even.
  -- The number `4` is an even integer.
  -- We can prove that `(4 : ℤ)` is even by showing there exists an integer k such that 4 = 2 * k.
  -- We choose k = 2.
  have h_4_even : Even (4 : ℤ) := by
    -- The definition of Even n for integers is ∃ k : ℤ, n = 2 * k.
    -- We need to show ∃ k : ℤ, 4 = 2 * k.
    use 2
    -- The goal is now to show 4 = 2 * 2.
    -- We use norm_num to evaluate the numerical equality.
    norm_num
  -- Since `4` is even, we should use the hypothesis `h₁`.
  -- `h₁` states: `∀ n, Even n → f n = n^2 - 4*n -1`.
  -- We apply `h₁` with `n = 4` and provide the proof that `4` is even.
  have h_f_4_eq : f 4 = (4 : ℤ)^2 - (4 : ℤ) * (4 : ℤ) - 1 := by
    apply h₁
    exact h_4_even
  -- Now we need to evaluate the expression `(4 : ℤ)^2 - (4 : ℤ) * (4 : ℤ) - 1` and show it equals `-1`.
  -- `4^2 = 16`, `4 * 4 = 16`. The expression becomes `16 - 16 - 1`.
  -- `16 - 16 = 0`. The expression becomes `0 - 1`.
  -- `0 - 1 = -1`.
  -- We can use `norm_num` to perform this integer calculation.
  have h_calculation : (4 : ℤ)^2 - (4 : ℤ) * (4 : ℤ) - 1 = -1 := by
    norm_num
  -- We have `h_f_4_eq : f 4 = (4 : ℤ)^2 - (4 : ℤ) * (4 : ℤ) - 1`
  -- and `h_calculation : (4 : ℤ)^2 - (4 : ℤ) * (4 : ℤ) - 1 = -1`.
  -- By transitivity of equality (using `rw`), we can substitute the calculation result into the equation for `f 4`.
  rw [h_f_4_eq, h_calculation]
  -- The goal is now -1 = -1, which is automatically solved by rfl.
  -- The previous `rfl` tactic was redundant as the goal was already solved definitionally.
