    -- The goal is an equality, so no binders need to be introduced with `intro`.
    -- The variables and hypothesis are already available from the theorem statement.
    -- Removed the unnecessary `intro` tactic.

    -- The original code correctly intended to derive a complex equality from the real hypothesis h₀.
    -- The subsequent `have` block proves this intermediate complex equality.
    -- We proceed with the original logic after the dummy `intro`.
    -- The hypothesis h₀ is an equality between real numbers. We want an equality between complex numbers.
    -- Coercing the equality to complex numbers requires applying Complex.ofReal to both sides.
    -- The `congr_arg Complex.ofReal h₀` tactic achieves this.
    -- The `simp` tactic can use lemmas about Complex.ofReal distributing over arithmetic operations (`Complex.ofReal_add`, `Complex.ofReal_mul`)
    -- and Complex.ofReal acting as a coercion for integer literals (`Complex.ofReal_int_cast`).
    -- Applying `simp` to the coerced equality `h_coerced` transforms it into the desired form of `h1_normSq_complex`.
    -- Now h_coerced has the exact type required for h1_normSq_complex.

    -- -- The previous `have h1_normSq_complex := by` block was implicitly trying to prove the main theorem goal,
    -- -- but the code inside it was proving the coerced hypothesis.
    -- -- The `exact h_coerced` at the end was attempting to prove the main goal using the coerced hypothesis,
    -- -- leading to a type mismatch.

      -- The literals in the original h₀ are Nat (12, 2, 31) or implicitly Complex (2 in z+2, 1 in z^2+1).
      -- `Complex.ofReal` coerces the result of `normSq` (Real) and Nat literals (12, 2, 31).
      -- `Complex.ofReal ((12:ℕ) * r)` becomes `(12:ℂ) * ofReal r` by `Complex.ofReal_mul_cast` (part of `simp`).
