  -- The goal is to prove s 3 11 = 1/33.
  -- The hypothesis h₀ defines s x y when x ≠ 0 and y ≠ 0.
  -- For the goal, we have x = 3 and y = 11. We need to show 3 ≠ 0 and 11 ≠ 0.
  -- These are true for real numbers.

  -- Apply the definition of s using the hypothesis h₀.
  -- The hypothesis h₀ takes x, y, a proof of x ≠ 0, and a proof of y ≠ 0.
  -- We need to apply it to x = 3 and y = 11, providing the proofs `three_ne_zero` and `eleven_ne_zero`.

  -- The goal is now (1 / 11 - 1 / 3) / (3 - 11) = 1 / 33.
  -- This is an equation involving fractions. We can use `field_simp` to simplify it.
  -- `field_simp` will simplify the expression by finding common denominators and clearing them.
  field_simp
  -- After `field_simp`, the goal is simplified to an identity like `(-8) * 33 = 33 * (-8)`.
  -- `rfl` failed because the two sides are not definitionally equal.
  -- We can use `ring` to prove this algebraic equality.
