  (h₂ : 2 * (a + b)=54) :
  (a^2 + b^2) = 369 := by 
  -- We are given a*b = 180 and 2*(a+b) = 54. We want to prove a^2 + b^2 = 369.
  -- First, simplify the second equation to find a+b.
  have h_sum : a + b = 27 := by
    -- Divide both sides of h₂ by 2.
    -- We want to derive (a + b) = 27 from 2 * (a + b) = 54 (h₂).
    -- We can divide both sides of the equality by 2.
    have h₂_div_two : (2 * (a + b)) / 2 = 54 / 2 := by rw [h₂]
    -- Simplify the expression (2 * (a + b)) / 2 on the left side.
    -- According to the error message, simp simplifies the left side but not the right.
    simp at h₂_div_two
    -- Simplify the numerical expression 54 / 2 on the right side using norm_num.
    -- The error message indicates that simp did not simplify the numerical fraction 54/2 to 27.
    -- We explicitly use norm_num to perform this numerical simplification.

    -- Now h₂_div_two is `a + b = 27`.

  -- We know the identity (a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2.
  -- Rearranging gives a^2 + b^2 = (a+b)^2 - 2ab.
  have identity : a^2 + b^2 = (a + b) ^ 2 - 2 * (a * b) := by
    -- Use ring to prove the identity.

  -- Now substitute the values from h_sum and h₁ into the identity.

  -- Now the goal is 27^2 - 2 * 180 = 369.
