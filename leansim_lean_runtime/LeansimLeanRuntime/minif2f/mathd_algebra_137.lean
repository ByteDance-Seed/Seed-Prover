  -- The hypothesis is ↑x + (4/100) * ↑x = 598. All terms are in ℝ due to coercion.

  -- Factor out ↑x from the left side: ↑x + (1/25) * ↑x = ↑x * (1 + 1/25)
  -- This is an application of the distributive property a + b*a = a*(1+b).

  rw [h_sum] at h₀

  -- h₀ is now: ↑x * ((26:ℝ) / (25:ℝ)) = 598

  -- We have an equation of the form a * b = c, where a = ↑x, b = (26:ℝ)/(25:ℝ), c = 598.
  -- We want to isolate a: a = c / b.
  -- We need to show that b is non-zero to divide.
  have h_coeff_nz : (26:ℝ) / (25:ℝ) ≠ 0 := by norm_num

  -- Use the property that a * b = c and b ≠ 0 implies a = c / b.
  -- The theorem `eq_div_iff_mul_eq` states `a = b / c ↔ a * c = b` given `c ≠ 0`.
  -- We apply the reverse direction (`mpr`) of this equivalence, using h₀ as the premise `a * c = b`.
  -- The theorem eq_div_iff_mul_eq takes the hypothesis c ≠ 0 as an explicit argument.

    -- The previous line had `(eq_div_iff_mul_eq _ _ _ h_coeff_nz)`. The `_ _ _` before `h_coeff_nz` were incorrect syntax for applying the theorem.

  -- h_isolated is now: ↑x = 598 / (26/25)

  -- Simplify the right-hand side of the equation.
  -- 598 / (26/25) = 598 * (25/26) = (598/26) * 25 = 23 * 25 = 575.

  -- h_isolated is now: ↑x = 575.
  -- This is an equality between the coercion of x to ℝ and the literal 575 (which is interpreted as (575 : ℝ)).
  -- So we have (↑x : ℝ) = (575 : ℝ).

  -- Since x is a natural number and 575 is a natural number, we can use the injectivity
  -- of the coercion from ℕ to ℝ (Nat.cast_inj) to conclude the equality in ℕ.
  -- Nat.cast_inj : (↑a : ℝ) = ↑b ↔ a = b for a b : ℕ
  -- We use the forward implication: (↑a : ℝ) = ↑b → a = b.
  -- We apply Nat.cast_inj.mp to h_isolated.
