  (h₁ : a + b = 2) :
  a = 1 ∧ b = 1 := by 
  -- We are given a system of two linear equations with two variables a and b:
  -- h₀ : 3a + 2b = 5
  -- h₁ : a + b = 2
  -- We need to prove that the unique solution is a = 1 and b = 1.
  -- The `linarith` tactic is suitable for solving linear equations and inequalities.
  -- We can use `linarith` to derive the values of a and b directly from the given hypotheses.

  -- First, let's prove that a = 1 using the hypotheses h₀ and h₁.
  have ha : a = 1 := by
    linarith [h₀, h₁]

  -- Next, let's prove that b = 1 using the same hypotheses h₀ and h₁.
  have hb : b = 1 := by
    linarith [h₀, h₁]

  -- The goal is to prove the conjunction a = 1 ∧ b = 1.
  -- We can use the `constructor` tactic to split this goal into two separate goals: a = 1 and b = 1.
  constructor
  -- The first subgoal is a = 1. We have already proven this as `ha`.
  exact ha
  -- The second subgoal is b = 1. We have already proven this as `hb`.
