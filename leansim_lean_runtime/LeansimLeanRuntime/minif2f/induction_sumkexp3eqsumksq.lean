  -- The most common way to prove identities involving natural numbers and sums over ranges
  -- is by induction on `n`.
  -- The original code attempted to apply a multiplication/division lemma at the top level,
  -- which does not match the main goal (an equality of sums). This caused the 'apply failed' error.
  -- We will restructure the proof using induction on `n`.
