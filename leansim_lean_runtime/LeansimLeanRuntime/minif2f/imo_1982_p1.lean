    -- The expression `(1982 : ℕ) / (3 : ℕ)` computes to `(660 : ℕ)`.
    -- This can be verified, for example, by using `#eval (1982 : ℕ) / (3 : ℕ)` in Lean, which outputs `660`.
    -- Therefore, the goal is equivalent to `(660 : ℕ) = (660 : ℕ)`.
    -- The `rw` tactic, after performing the rewrite, often attempts to simplify the resulting goal by reflexivity (`rfl`).
    -- Since the goal became an identity `(660 : ℕ) = (660 : ℕ)`, `rw` was able to close it automatically.
    -- Consequently, the subsequent `exact subprob_1982_div_3_proof` tactic was redundant, as there were no goals left to solve.
