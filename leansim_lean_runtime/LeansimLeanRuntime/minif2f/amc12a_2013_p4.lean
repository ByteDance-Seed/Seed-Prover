theorem amc12a_2013_p4 :
  (2^2014 + 2^2012) / (2^2014 - 2^2012) = (5:ℝ) / 3 := by
  -- The goal is implicitly interpreted with Real division because the RHS is Real.
  -- The Nat expressions 2^n are automatically cast to Real ((2:ℝ)^n).
  -- Goal: ((2:ℝ)^2014 + (2:ℝ)^2012) / ((2:ℝ)^2014 - (2:ℝ)^2012) = (5:ℝ) / 3

  -- We clear denominators using `field_simp`. We need to show denominators are non-zero.

  -- The denominator on the left is (2:ℝ)^2014 - (2:ℝ)^2012.
  -- Since the base (2:ℝ) is greater than 1, (2:ℝ)^n is strictly increasing with n.
  -- Since 2014 ≠ 2012, (2:ℝ)^2014 ≠ (2:ℝ)^2012, so their difference is non-zero.
  have h_2_gt_1 : (2:ℝ) > 1 := by norm_num
  -- The theorem `pow_right_strictMono` states that the function n ↦ a^n is strictly monotone if a > 1.
  have h_pow_strict_mono : StrictMono (fun n : ℕ => (2:ℝ) ^ n) := by
    apply pow_right_strictMono
    exact h_2_gt_1
  -- The `Injective` type is needed to deduce that distinct exponents imply distinct powers for base > 1.
  have h_pow_injective : Function.Injective (fun n : ℕ => (2:ℝ) ^ n) := by
    -- Changed `Injective` to `Function.Injective` to fix the "unknown identifier" error.
    -- The proof derives injectivity from strict monotonicity using `StrictMono.injective`.
    exact h_pow_strict_mono.injective

  -- The exponents 2014 and 2012 are distinct natural numbers.
  have h_2014_ne_2012 : 2014 ≠ 2012 := by norm_num
  -- Since the function n ↦ (2:ℝ)^n is injective for base 2 > 1, distinct exponents give distinct results.
  have h_pow_ne : (2:ℝ)^2014 ≠ (2:ℝ)^2012 := by
    -- We use the contrapositive of injectivity. If (2:ℝ)^2014 = (2:ℝ)^2012, then 2014 = 2012.
    -- Since 2014 ≠ 2012, we must have (2:ℝ)^2014 ≠ (2:ℝ)^2012.

  -- The difference of two unequal numbers is non-zero.
  have h_den_nonzero : (2:ℝ)^2014 - (2:ℝ)^2012 ≠ 0 := by
    exact sub_ne_zero_of_ne h_pow_ne

  -- The denominator on the right is (3:ℝ).
  have h_3_nonzero : (3:ℝ) ≠ 0 := by norm_num

  -- Apply `field_simp` to clear denominators, providing the non-zero proofs.
  -- This transforms the goal from `A/B = C/D` to `A*D = C*B`.

  -- Goal: ((2:ℝ)^2014 + (2:ℝ)^2012) * 3 = ((2:ℝ)^2014 - (2:ℝ)^2012) * 5

  -- We want to simplify the terms by factoring out a common power.
  -- We can write 2014 = 2012 + 2.
  have h_sum : 2014 = 2012 + 2 := by norm_num

  -- Rewrite the exponent 2014 using h_sum.
  rw [h_sum]
  -- Goal: ((2:ℝ)^(2012 + 2) + (2:ℝ)^2012) * (3 : ℝ) = ((2:ℝ)^(2012 + 2) - (2:ℝ)^2012) * (5 : ℝ)

  -- Now use the theorem `pow_add` which states a^(m+n) = a^m * a^n.
  -- Apply this to the terms with exponent 2012 + 2 using `rw`.
  rw [pow_add (2:ℝ) 2012 2]
  -- Goal: ((2 : ℝ) ^ 2012 * (2 : ℝ) ^ 2 + (2 : ℝ) ^ 2012) * (3 : ℝ) = ((2 : ℝ) ^ 2012 * (2 : ℝ) ^ 2 - (2 : ℝ) ^ 2012) * (5 : ℝ)

  -- The goal is an equality involving multiplication, addition, and subtraction.
  -- The previous proof attempt tried to perform factoring manually, which failed due to
  -- subtle issues with rewriting when multiplication is commutative.
  -- The resulting goal is a polynomial equality in terms of (2:ℝ)^2012 and (2:ℝ)^2.
  -- We can let `a = (2:ℝ)^2012` and `b = (2:ℝ)^2`. The goal is (a*b + a)*3 = (a*b - a)*5.
  -- This is a simple algebraic identity that `ring` can solve directly.
  -- Removing the explicit factoring steps and using `ring` here.
