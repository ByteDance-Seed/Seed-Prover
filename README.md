This page is used to store the Seed AI4Math groupâ€™s research projects, including Seedâ€‘Prover and Deltaâ€‘Prover.

- **Seed Prover** Seedâ€‘Prover is the system we officially participated with in the IMO 2025.
- **Delta prover** Deltaâ€‘Prover is a separate project focused on researching test time techniques for generating formal proofs.

## Seed Prover IMO 2025
Seed Prover solved 4 out of 6 problems in IMO 2025 durint the context, with the following breakdown:
- **Day 1**: Fully solved P2 (geometry) and P3 (number theory), fully solved P1  (combinatorics) after the competition.
- **Day 2**: Fully solved P4 (number theory) and P5 (combinatorics / algebra)

### Details
- P1 (combinatorics) [Lean](SeedProver/imo2025/p1.lean) : Fully proved after the competition, this is not scored by the IMO.
- P2 (geometry) [NL](SeedProver/imo2025/p2_proof.pdf) : Generated and verified in 2 seconds using Seed-Geometry system
- P3 (number theory) [NL](SeedProver/imo2025/p3_proof.pdf) [Lean](SeedProver/imo2025/p3.lean): Solved in 3 days, with a 2000-line formal proof
- P4 (number theory) [NL](SeedProver/imo2025/p4_proof.pdf) [Lean](SeedProver/imo2025/p4.lean): Solved in 3 days, with a 4000-line formal proof
- P5 (combinatorics / algebra) [NL](SeedProver/imo2025/p5_proof.pdf) [Lean](SeedProver/imo2025/p5.lean): Solved in 1 day, with a proof slightly different from known human solutions

P1,3,4,5 are compiled under Lean v4.14.0.
