ðŸ¤– Introducing **Delta Prover**, an agent-based framework that enables general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex formal proofs in Lean 4, without any model specialization.

- **New State-of-the-Art Performance**: Delta Prover achieves a **95.9%** success rate on the miniF2F-test benchmark, surpassing all existing approaches, including those requiring specialized, fine-tuned models.
- **No Fine-Tuning Required**: By orchestrating the interaction between a general-purpose LLM and the Lean 4 environment, Delta Prover circumvents the need for costly data collection and model training, making powerful theorem proving more accessible.
- **Superior Scaling**: The framework exhibits a significantly stronger test-time scaling law compared to standard Best-of-N proof generation strategies, showcasing a more efficient path to solving harder problems.
- **Agentic Reasoning**: Our findings demonstrate that general-purpose LLMs possess substantial untapped theorem-proving capabilities that can be unlocked when guided by an effective agentic structure, presenting a computationally efficient alternative for robust automated reasoning.

## Core Components of Delta Prover

At its core, Delta Prover integrates two novel, interdependent components that allow a general-purpose LLM to interactively construct formal proofs.

- **Reflective Decomposition and Iterative Repair**: An algorithmic framework that empowers the agent to reflect on the current proof state, decompose complex problems into manageable sub-goals, and intelligently repair incorrect proof steps through interaction with the Lean 4 environment.
- **Custom Domain-Specific Language (DSL)**: A purpose-built DSL layered on top of Lean 4, designed to streamline subproblem management. This allows the agent to clearly define, track, and solve intermediate goals within the larger proof structure.
